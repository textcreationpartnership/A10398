            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16098:4"/>vs, we muſt ſerue his prouidence, and follow that for the right way wherein he leads vs and goes before vs. Neither doe I purpoſe onely to enter vpon this Argument now, and ſo let it reſt, but as we haue our monthly Communions, ſo (if God enable me) I meane to make my digreſſions and proceedings into this Argument accordingly; that ſo I may confine the knowledge of the Lords Supper to the vſe of the Lords Supper (for when ſhould we know what belongs to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?) that our knowledge and our practiſe may quote and ſecond one another; our knowledge may direct our practiſe, and our practiſe may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and confirme our knowledge, by continuall ſenſible and liuely practiſe: My courſe God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhall be this, euerie next Sabboth, before the Communion Sabboth, I will treat of ſome points or other touching the Lords Supper, as they ſhall offer themſelues in their due order; ſome prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation muſt needs be made, the weeke dayes cannot conueniently be ſpared, becauſe of worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faries; that which is made the morning wherein you are to receiue, is good, but not ſufficient, there is required ſome time of reſpite for Meditation, betwixt your hearing and receiuing, therefore it is fitteſt to begin the Sabboth day before, that you may haue ſome ſeaſoning, ſome profitable matter to feed vpon all the weeke long, whereby if you haue any grace in your Hearts, you may be put in continuall remembrance what a great worke you are to vndertake the Sabboth following; and ſo be quickned to examine your ſelues, and ſearch
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16098:5"/>your Hearts and liues, and practiſe your repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſtirre vp your Faith, and to be earneſt with God in Prayer, and to put forth your beſt endeuors for your fitting to that heauenly worke. After the Sacrament is receiued, the ſame points to be here rehearſed againe, that ſo you may take a view of your ſelues, and of your carriage in that Spirituall Banket; that if vpon this re-view you find, that you haue truely endeuored to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in his owne Ordinance, your conſciences may haue peace, and God the prayſe and honour; If you haue groſſely fayled, I ſay groſſely in ſome palpable and notorious euill (for who fayles not more or leſſe in his beſt actions?) you may iudge your ſelues and repent of your faylings, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat mercy for that which is paſt, and better grace for the time to come. This courſe ſhall be as the former and latter Raine, for we are all of vs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous hard hearted to Spirituall duties, we had need be moyſtened againe and againe, before our Hearts can be mollified and fitted for any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: The handling of the points the Sabboth day before, is as the former Raine to water and moyſten our Hearts, and bring them to ſome ſoft temper that they may be apt to receiue the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the heauenly Seale, and open themſelues to giue entertainment to our bleſſed Sauiour: The rehearſall after the receiuing, is as the latter Raine to water vs again, that Chriſt Ieſus being receiued into our Hearts, may proſper and thriue, and grow in vs to a further encreaſe of grace; and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and encreaſing from one Communion to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16098:5"/>another, we may in time attaine thorough Gods bleſſing, to ſome good ripeneſſe for the Lords Harueſt.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons inducing me to this courſe are many, I will acquaint you with them, becauſe they will be good encouragements both to you and me in theſe proceedings, and will alſo quicken vs and further vs to our preparation.</p>
            <p>The firſt Reaſon is the diſcharge of my dutie; God hath made me a Watchman ouer you, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.7. and what is the office of a Watchman? To heare &amp; to admoniſh; to take ſpeciall notice of the ſtate of their People, and to inſtruct them in their duties, and admoniſh them of their dangers; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concernes your Spirituall ſtate more, then the reuerent and worthy receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no dutie more neceſſarie to be taught; no greater danger then the prophanation and abuſe of it; I therefore being your Watchman muſt looke into your ſtate in this behalfe, and tell you your duties, that you may preuent thoſe dangers. The Sacraments are a part of Gods ſauing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as well as the Word, and the due admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of them, is a part of my Miniſteriall office, as well as the Preaching of the Word; and it is my dutie to labour and ſee, that you be worthy Receiuers of the Sacraments, as well as profitable Hearers of the Word; The Apoſtles practiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. to the end, is an excellent precedent in this caſe: Many abuſes were crept into the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> other things he lets alone till he come himſelfe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 34. but theſe that were in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16098:6"/>the Sacrament muſt ſpeedily be reformed, and therefore he preſently diſpatched his Epiſtle, and ſends his mind and charge touching the redreſſe of them. And ſurely corruptions in ſuch a high part of Gods Worſhip as is the Lords Supper, are dangerous Sores, except they be cured with all expedition, they will feſter and wranckle, and quickly corrupt the verie Heart of Religion. In conſcience therefore of my dutie to God and you, for the preuenting of theſe euils, I haue vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this courſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon is the care of your Soules; They are deere and precious to the Lord that bought them, and therefore ought to be deere and precious to all Gods Miniſters whom the Holy Ghoſt hath made Ouerſeers of them, and that is it which the Apoſtle ſeemes to preſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed to the Flocke ouer whom the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Ouerſeers, &amp;c. which God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his owne Blood.</hi> I ſhould be loath to be a Miniſter of Condemnation to any of you, the power that the Lord hath giuen vs is for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not for deſtruction; if I ſhould adminiſter the Sacrament to you in your ignorance, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe, or vnpreparedneſſe; I ſhould be a verie vnnaturall Father, <hi>To giue you Stones when you aske for Bread, and a Scorpion when you aske for Fiſh:</hi> Bane and Poyſon in ſtead of Comfort and Food for your Soules, it ſhould but further your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. In care therefore of your Soules, I labour to prepare you. Conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27.29. <hi>He that eats
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16098:6"/>and drinkes vnworthily, ſhall be guiltie of the Body and Blood of the Lord: and he eats and drinkes his owne damnation.</hi> What is it to eat and drinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily? That is, without knowledge, reuerence, conſcience, faith, and repentance, without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And what is the ſinne? <hi>Guiltie of the Body and Blood of the Lord:</hi> You draw the guiltineſſe of the Blood of the Lord Ieſus vpon your Soules, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did when they ſaid, <hi>His Blood be vpon vs, &amp;c.</hi> You are as bad as theſe cruell Murtherers that killed the Lord of Life: And what ſhall be the puniſhment? <hi>He eats and drinkes his owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi> A fearefull, yet a iuſt reward of ſuch a fearefull ſinne. The manner of the Apoſtles ſpeech is verie remarkable, <hi>He eats and drinkes his owne damnation:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, while he is eating and drinking at the Lords table, the Diuell is carrying away his Soule into Hell. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.4. If we ſee our Brothers Oxe or his Aſſe fall by the way, we muſt helpe them vp: Hath God ſuch care of Oxen and Aſſes, and not much rather of Mens Soules? And ſhall euerie Brother lift vp his Brothers Beaſt being fallen on the Ground, and ſhall not euerie Miniſter much more lift vp his Brothers Soule being fallen downe into Hell? My exhortation therefore to you is, that you would ioyne with me, in the care for your owne Soules: To whom ſhould a Mans Soule be moſt deere, but to himſelfe? Doe not ſleepe any longer in your ignorance; ſhake off your careleſſeneſſe and ſecuritie; come no more to the Lords Table for faſhion and cuſtome, but for conſcience to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16098:7"/>God, and to encreaſe in grace; keepe your ſelues from that fearefull ſinne of <hi>eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnworthily,</hi> that ye incurre not the fearefull puniſhment of <hi>eternall damnation.</hi> Heare and learne and practiſe ſuch good Doctrines and Inſtructions as the Lord by my Miniſtry ſhall afford you; and your Soules ſhall liue.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon is the zeale I haue for Gods glorie; God is honoured by Men no way more, then in their publike meeting and aſſemblyes for exerciſes of Religion, nor in any of thoſe meetings more, then at this heauenly Banket; and therefore if we haue any zeale for Gods glorie, we muſt be ſpecially zealous and carefull that God may be honoured by vs, in the performance of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <hi>He will be ſanctified in all that come neere him, Leuit.</hi> 10.3. In this action we approach neareſt to God, euen to become one with Chriſt Ieſus, and hereby to be incorporated into his Body, as Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of this Fleſh, and therefore we muſt ſanctifie and glorifie God in this exerciſe aboue all other. It grieues me to ſee the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors in this kind, how horribly the Lord is diſhonoured amongſt Men, euen in this moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſanctified Ordinance; ſome comming onely for faſhion ſake, few for conſciences, not one amongſt a great many, with that due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that may make their ſeruice herein accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and Gods holy Sacrament comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable to their owne Soules: In zeale therefore for the Lord of Hoaſts, that his great Name and Maieſtie may be rightly and truly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16098:7"/>in the right and true vſe of this his ſauing Ordinance, I deſire to fit you to a reuerent and faithfull participation of this holy Sacrament, as not knowing wherein either I, or you, may honor God more, and doe him better ſeruice.</p>
            <p>The fourth Reaſon is the preciouſneſſe of the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the greateſt, and weightieſt, and moſt vnualuable buſineſſe, that euer was performed ſince the Worlds Creation; He, the Lambe vndefiled and without ſpot, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Man, the Holy One of God, his owne glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sonne; the Liquor that is preſt out of ſuch goodly Grapes muſt needs be a ſweet and pleaſant Iuice; the Blood that iſſues out of his bleſſed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and from his ſacred Wounds, muſt needs be moſt pure and moſt precious; euerie drop of this heauenly Dew, is worth a worlds ranſome; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be thought or ſpoken of, much leſſe to be purpoſely remembred, and ſolemnely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, in the Sacrament, but with all holy prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and affection, and eleuation of Spirit. For the deepe impreſſion of the death of Ieſus Chriſt into our Hearts, let vs conſider rightly theſe three things, which will be as ſo many ſpurres vnto vs, to ſtirre vs vp, to a more reuerent eſtimation and embracing of this Sacrament. Firſt, the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his death to him: Secondly, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it to vs: Thirdly, the acceptableneſſe of it to God. Firſt, the bitterneſſe of it to himſelfe: It was exceeding bitter to him, it coſt him many a deepe ſigh and groane, many teares and ſtrong cryings, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.7. A ſore Agony in the Garden,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16098:8"/>with a bloody ſweat in his Body, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. And a deadly heauineſſe in his Soule, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.38. A hard conflict with the terrors of Death, and the wrath of God vpon him, for our ſinnes: for that grieuous trouble ſpoken of <hi>Math.</hi> 26.37. could not ariſe from any bodily feares or paines, but he was then coping and cloſing with the very terrors of God, due to vs, but to be endured by him: God ſet him as a Marke before him, to ſhoot at him, and to ſpend vpon him all the Arrowes of his Vengeance, which were prepared for all beleeuing ſinners from the beginning to the end of the World. For many Men haue ſuffered a bodily death without any ſuch daunting. Chriſt is of a more valorous ſpirit then ſo, many a ſore blow did he receiue both from God and Man; Men ſmot him and buffeted him, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.67. They platted a Crowne of Thornes and put it on his Head, and ſmot him on the Head, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.29, 30. And all this and a great deale more came vpon him, &amp; yet there was none to pitty him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.20. The Lord from Heauen he ſmot him, and brake him, and layd vpon him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.6.10. as it were ſtroake vpon ſtroake, till he had reuenged himſelfe to the full vpon him. He did not ſpare him though he were his owne Sonne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. For when Chriſt was vpon the Croſſe, then he was reputed the common ſinner of the World, and ſo all the Vials of the wrath of God were to be poured out and emptied vpon him. Was this Death ſo bitter to him, and ſhall we be lightly affected toward it? Shall we come coldly and vnpreparedly to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16098:8"/>memoriall of it? Shall we ſee this bitter Death of his acted as it were in a holy Tragedy before our Eyes, and ſhall not we be much moued and yearne in our Bowels at the ſight, and thought, and memoriall of it? Put the caſe we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, and another Man in loue ſhould take our death vpon him for vs, how compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately would wee bee affected towards him, and the death that hee ſuffers for vs? Wee would goe into our Chambers, and mourne, and waile, and melt in our ſelues at the thought of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for vs, and his loue to vs, and our wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that hath brought him, to ſuch a death: much more ſhould we be ſtirred vp, to a thorough fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſufferings and death of Chriſt Ieſus, which we wretched ſinners haue brought vpon him: For it was more that the Sonne of God ſhould dye, then if the whole World ſhould dye: The bitterneſſe of his death was cauſed by the bitterneſſe of our ſins; and therefore the thought of his death ſhould alwayes ſtirre vs vp to true repentance, to a hatred and deteſtation of our ſins, and to looke vpon the Lord Ieſus, with a broken Heart, and a mourning Spirit, and a wounded Conſcience, and a ſighing Soule, whom we haue ſo grieuouſly pierced with our ſinnes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall looke vpon him whom they haue pierced, they ſhall mourne for him, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it to vs, it is maruailous cordiall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to vs, Gaule and Vineger to him, but Milke and Hony to vs; his abaſing is our exalting; his ſufferings are our victorie; his torments our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16098:9"/>eaſe; his wounds our cure; his croſſe our crowne; his ſhame our glorie; his death our life; he dying in our ſtead; looke how bitter our death was to him, ſo comfortable is his death to vs; looke how much he was diſparaged by our death, ſo much are we aduantaged by his; it was but one death in it ſelfe, but it is double in effect; as our death, that is, being due to vs, ſo it was a bitter death to Chriſt; but as his death, that is to ſay, as being endured in his Perſon for vs, ſo it is to vs moſt comfortable; <hi>We were healed by his ſtripes, Eſay</hi> 53.5. He bore our ſtripes, and thereby are we healed; we chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtates with our Sauiour, and he with vs; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued our ſinnes, we receiue his righteouſneſſe; he our miſerie, we his happineſſe; he our death, we his life; a bleſſed change for vs, that in ſtead of Sinne, Death and Hell thereby deſerued, we ſhould find Righteouſneſſe, and Life, and Heauen pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the death of Chriſt Ieſus; when the Life, and Blood of Chriſt Ieſus guſht out of his Body, by his wounds, then were all the Fountaines of Heauen as it were, all the Flood-gates of Gods Mercie ſet wide open, and then was all Grace, and Comfort, and Life, and Saluation ſhowred downe vpon all beleeuers, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my Blood ſhed for you for the remiſsion of ſinnes;</hi> it was the ſhedding of his Blood, it is the remiſſion of our ſinnes; the ſmart was his, the ſweetneſſe is ours; he is wounded, we are cured; he is puniſhed, we are acquitted; he dyes for vs, and by his death we are made aliue. Thirdly and laſtly, the acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God, it was infinitely pleaſing to God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16098:9"/>his Father, there is God, and Chriſt, and Man; Chriſt enduring the bitterneſſe of death; Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and deliuered by it; God himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall infinitely pleaſed: Man had ſinned, and thereby enthralled himſelfe to Death, and Hell, and Damnation, and except he be redeemed, he periſheth without recouerie: God was offended, and his wrath did burne like fire, againſt Mankind for their ſinnes, and except he be pacified, they are all damned without mercie: Chriſt Ieſus came and tooke our Nature vpon him, and dyed for our ſinnes, and by the bitterneſſe hath redeemed vs, and pacified God: His offering himſelfe for vs, <hi>was a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſauour to God. Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. Alwayes the beloued Sonne of God, but then beſt-beloued, if we may eſteeme accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our apprehenſion, when he was performing the higheſt and vtmoſt act of his filiall obedience, <hi>Obedient to the death, euen to the death of the Croſſe, Phil.</hi> 2.8. When is a Child beſt-beloued of his Father, but when he is moſt obedient? The Lord was alwayes well-pleaſed in him, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.17. but then moſt of all, if we may iudge by the effects, when he was vpon the Croſſe, for then and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was the Lord well-pleaſed thorough him with all the Faithfull, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. the Lord then ſmelling a ſauour of reſt, whereby, as in the dayes of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 8.21. he was pacified towards the World. Spices are ſweeteſt when they are broken and pounded, and ſo was Chriſt, when his Body was broken and pounded vpon the Croſſe: And as when <hi>Mary</hi> brake the Boxe of Oyntment, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16098:10"/>whole Houſe was filled with the fauour of it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.3. So when Chriſt, who was full of good Oyntments, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. had his Body broken on the Croſſe, Heauen and Earth were filled with the ſweet ſauour thereof, and many reaſons may be alleaged why it ſhould be ſo well pleaſing to God. Firſt, it was Gods pleaſure and ordinance, that Chriſt ſhould dye for vs, and he ordained it, in the heighth of his loue to vs: <hi>God ſo loued the world, &amp;c.</hi> And he cannot chuſe but be infinitely pleaſed, with his owne worke, ſpecially the worke of his greateſt loue. Secondly, he delights not in the <hi>death of a ſinner, but rather that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and liue;</hi> therefore this being the Life and Saluation of ſinfull beleeuers, it muſt needs be delightfull and pleaſing to God. Thirdly, it was as it were Gods owne Blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. For howſoeuer God is not as Man, made of Fleſh and Blood, yet the Perſon of Chriſt, who was our Mediator, being God and Man, the Blood that came from him as he was Man, by reaſon of the perſonall Vnion of both Natures in that his owne Perſon, may iuſtly be ſaid to be the Blood of God; and how can it chuſe but the Blood of God, ſhould be infinitely pleaſing to God? Laſtly, it muſt make amends for all the ſinnes of all Beleeuers: now all our ſinnes, euen the beſt of them, are maruailous filthy, and loathſome before the Lord, our verie righteouſneſſe is as a filthy Clout before the pure Eyes of Gods Iuſtice; and therefore, there being ſo many Beleeuers to be ſaued, and euerie Beleeuer hauing ſo many ſinnes, and euerie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16098:10"/>ſinne being ſo loathſome and odious before the Lord, it muſt needs be a verie ſweet Sacrifice, that muſt take away all that filthineſſe; and that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt needs be infinitely pleaſing to God, which makes perfect ſatisfaction and recompence, for our infinite ſinnes. Now if it be ſo ſweet and infinitely pleaſing to God, ſhall we neglect it? Or come like Stockes and Stones vnto it, without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and without life, without a liuely and a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehenſion of the infinite excellencie, of this ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice? Let vs ſtirre vp our ſelues, to eſteeme reuerently of it, as it well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues, and to take delight in it, as God delights in it, and accordingly let vs be fitted to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration and memoriall of it, in this Sacrament. In my vnfained affection therefore to the Lord, and our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and to his precious Death and Blood-ſhedding, ſo bitter to himſelfe, ſo comfortable to vs, ſo pleaſing to God, that the honour thereof may be rightly and worthily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced in our Hearts, as at all times, ſo eſpecially in the liuely commemoration of it in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, I haue vndertaken this taske of preparation, earneſtly deſiring, that the precious death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, may be preciouſly and graciouſly entertained, anſwerable in ſome meaſure to the excellent worthineſſe of that great Myſterie. Let vs therefore labour to make ſome vſe of theſe things: Let vs conſider, firſt that it is one of the greateſt parts of our Chriſtian dutie, to be well inſtructed and furniſhed for this Sacrament: Secondly, what daunger it is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16098:11"/>to our Soules if we come vnprepared, for then we <hi>eat and drinke our owne damnation:</hi> when we are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, the Diuell is blind-folding of vs, and carrying our Soules to Hell. Thirdly, let vs looke withall to Gods glorie; Is God moſt glorified by this? Then let vs be beſt prepared to it. Laſtly, let vs conſider the preciouſneſſe of the death of Chriſt, the greateſt worke that euer was performed ſince the World began, that Chriſt the Sonne of God ſhould ſhed his Blood for the ſinne of Man. It ought therefore to be prepared vnto with much eleuation, and with much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind: And when we haue it before our Eyes, and come to ſhew forth the Lords death, we muſt bring with vs all preparation, reuerence, faith, and eleuation that we can by Prayer, or any good endeuour attaine vnto; and we muſt further conſider the bitterneſſe of the death of Chriſt, and muſt come as if then we were to be crucified with him, euerie one of vs that looke for a part in his death for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of his death muſt goe to our Hearts; we muſt looke vnto him whom we haue pierced by our ſinnes, with mourning Eyes, and drouping Hearts; and then we muſt conſider, how comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this his death is to vs, it is the greateſt bleſſing that euer can befall vs in this World, Life, Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sinnes, Saluation, and what not? It is all in all. Laſtly, conſider how infinitely pleaſing it is to God, and know that if it be ſo pleaſing to him, if we prophane it, he will be infinitely diſpleaſed with vs. Let theſe things therefore ſtirre vs vp
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16098:11"/>to a reuerent partaking of this holy Myſtery. Thus you haue ſome ſeaſoning before hand, ſee how you can profit by it in the weeke; you haue ſome-what now to put you in mind, what you are to doe the next Sabboth; let euerie one thinke within himſelfe, and make it his whole weekes Meditation, I muſt goe to the Lords Supper the next Sabboth, therefore I muſt repent and call to God for mercie, and ſtedfaſtly purpoſe to leade a new life hereafter: If I come vnworthily, it is as much as my Soule is worth. Theſe things I would haue you to learne, and practiſe, and the Lord giue you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in them.</p>

Firſt, I will ſpeake of thoſe that are more common to the whole action, and the firſt name or title that we meet withall is, <hi>The Lords Table,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Ye cannot drinke the Cup of the Lord and the Cup of Diuels; ye cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and of the Table of the Diuels.</hi> The Apoſtle there is inueying bitterly againſt their Idolatrous Sacrifices, their offering to Idols, which he calles Diuels, for they are no better: and the Apoſtle tels them that if euer they looke to haue any benefite, in ſitting, and eating, and drinking at the Lords Table, they muſt vtterly forſake the Table of Diuels. It is <hi>the Lords Table,</hi> this is a borrowed ſpeech, the Table being taken for the Meate and Drinke that is receiued at the Table. The word imports many things worthy our conſideration: Firſt, it agrees with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie cuſtome of eating and drinking, which is vſually performed at a Table. Secondly, it carries ſome reference to the originall inſtitution, which was at the Table, there they did eat the Paſſeouer. Thirdly, it preſcribes a decencie and a ſeemely complement, euen of the outward materiall things that are of needfull vſe, in and about this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fourthly, it preuents all ſuperſtitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of any holineſſe in the Table it ſelfe, aboue other Tables, but onely ſo farre forth, as it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to this holy vſe; elſe there is no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16098:13"/>holineſſe in the Table it ſelfe. Fifthly, it condemnes the practiſe of the Popiſh Church, that make it, and call it an Altar rather then a Table; and their reaſon is ready; becauſe they might turne the Sacrament into a Sacrifice; for Sacrifices are confind to Altars, and Altars to Sacrifices. The ſecond name, it is called <hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <hi>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper.</hi> This title imports as much as the other, an eating and drinking, but this further includes two things more: Firſt, a ſpecification of the time when it was firſt inſtituted, and adminiſtred, being at night 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>The Lord Ieſus in the night that he was betrayed, tooke Bread, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. <hi>He tooke the Cup when he had ſupped, &amp;c.</hi> for our euening meales are our Suppers. And ſecondly, it hath alſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the preſent action, which at the firſt inſtitution it was accompanied withall; that is, <hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> wherein our Sauiour and his Diſciples did eat the Paſchall Lambe, which was a ſhaddow of this Sacrament: And each of theſe is particularly aſcribed to the Lord, that is, to Chriſt Ieſus. Now it is called <hi>The Lords Table,</hi> and <hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> not onely becauſe our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is Lord by a kind of excellencie, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath a ſpeciall right vnto this Sacrament, and a ſpeciall hand in it; as our Sabboth is called the Lords day in the <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.10. becauſe our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had a ſpeciall right to it, &amp; a ſpeciall hand in it either in inſtituting it himſelfe, or by his Apoſtles. There are many other names of which I will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16098:14"/>ſpeake hereafter, in the meane time we will ſeize and inſiſt a while vpon theſe two: And becauſe theſe two agree verie neere together, and are in effect as one, I will handle them both together, and deliuer the matter by way of obſeruation, as I haue done before.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> In that Ieſus Chriſt in both theſe titles is called the Lord, by a kind of ſingularitie or excellency, the obſeruation is this, Chriſt Ieſus is an abſolute Lord, the Lord of all Lords, the ſole Ruler and Gouernor of the whole World, ſpecially of the Church; for all theſe particulars are directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this name. I will handle the proofes of euerie particular by it ſelfe: Firſt, that Chriſt Ieſus is an abſolute Lord, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.3. compared with <hi>Marke</hi> 1.3. for the New Teſtament is an expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Old, and the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts the Interpreters of the Prophets, and therefore whereas <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaking as a Prophet had onely pointed out Chriſt ſome-what darkely, by this generall word, the Lord, <hi>Marke</hi> ſpeaking as an Euangeliſt, expounds the Prophet, and ſhewes plainly that Chriſt is that Lord there ſpoken of, as appeares in <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. compared with <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. And ſo you haue three teſtimonies in one, the Prophets, the Euangeliſts, and <hi>Iohn Baptiſts,</hi> for it was his Cry, they are but the reporters of it. If you add hereunto that in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. where the ſame matter is handled, you haue a fourth teſtimonie greater then all the reſt, God himſelfe calles him ſo, <hi>And the Lord whom you ſeeke ſhall ſpeedily come to his Temple, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Math.</hi> 21.3. our Sauiour ſends
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16098:14"/>two of his Diſciples to fetch the Aſſe and the Colt, and he bids them that if any Man ſay ought vnto them, that they ſhould ſay, <hi>The Lord hath need of them.</hi> There our Sauiour challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that verie title, for he is the Lord that had vſe of them, and this word imports that he is an abſolute Lord, and had an abſolute right in them, better right then the Lords and Owners had. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.11. The Angell calles him ſo, <hi>Vnto you is borne this day a Sauiour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> And ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Dauid</hi> calles him Lord, and the Apoſtle expounds it of Chriſt. And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calles him Lord in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. and ſo the whole companie of the Diſciples call him Lord in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.34. which ſaid, <hi>The Lord is riſen, &amp;c.</hi> Here you haue a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of teſtimonies together, God, and Chriſt, and the Angels; <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the Prophets, &amp; <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles, and the Euangeliſts, all ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether acknowledging him to be the Lord, that is, an abſolute Lord, &amp; it is an vſuall ſpeech in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles writings, to call him <hi>The Lord Ieſus,</hi> or <hi>the Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and this title is ſo proper to him, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other Perſons are ſpoken of together with him, they oft-times are called by ſome other titles, he by this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>For there is but one God which is the Father, and one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle calles the Father God, and Ieſus Chriſt Lord; not but that Chriſt is God alſo, and the Father is Lord; but ſo it pleaſeth the Holy Ghoſt to ſpeake of them for cauſes beſt knowne to himſelfe; and ſo in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. <hi>The ſame

We muſt vnderſtand that matters of Saluation are Spirituall, which come not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of our ſence, but are ſpiritually to be ſearched and reached vnto by the Eye of Faith: And hence it is, that God, willing to acquaint vs with them, doth ſet them forth vnto vs vnder the veiles of temporall things, and becauſe matters of Saluation are ſweet and comfortable, and refreſh the Heart, therefore the Holy Ghoſt makes choyce of ſuch outward things to veile and to ſhaddow them by, as are moſt vſuall and fitteſt for our comfort and refreſhing, as namely, Bankets and Feaſts: and ſo <hi>Math.</hi> 22.2. and forward, and <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19.9. and 2.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And according to this ground it is, that this Sacrament is ſet forth vnto vs in the name of a Feaſt, that is to ſay, a Spirituall Feaſt or Banket for our Soules. <hi>Prou.</hi> 9.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is ſaid of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that <hi>ſhe hath killed her Victuals, drawne her Wine, and prepared her Table:</hi> and what is the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to be receiued at this Feaſt? <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> as appeares in the 4 and 5 <hi>Verſes:</hi> by Wiſedome there, is meant the Sonne of God; the preparing of the Victuals and Table is the tendring vs of the meanes of Saluation, which is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16098:20"/>performed in a particular manner in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.26. <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt?

You may remember we ſhewed that the whole Doctrine of the Sacrament of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16098:25"/>Supper of the Lord may be reduced vnto theſe ſixe Heads: Firſt, the names or titles of it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the inſtitution of it: Thirdly, the nature of it: Fourthly, the parts of it: Fifthly, the power of it: And laſtly, the vſe of it. We haue entred vpon the names and titles of it, we haue ſeene that ſome are common to the whole action, and ſome are peculiar to the ſeuerall parts of the action: Common to the whole action that it is called the Lords Supper, or Lords Table, that is the firſt title; the Lords Table, that is a borrowed ſpeech, by the Table is meant the Meat or the Drinke that is receiued at the Table; it is called the Lords Supper, and there is as much intended as at the Table, eating and drinking; but withall there is further included both a ſpecification of the time, wherein the Sacrament was inſtituted in the night, at euening Meale or at Supper: Secondly withall, there is a ſpecification of that ſpeciall action that it was accompanied withall when it was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted (namely) at that Supper where our Sauiour Chriſt and his Diſciples did eat the Paſchall Lambe which was a Type and Figure of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, each of theſe are aſcribed to the Lord, the Lords Supper, or the Lords Table; wherein we ſhewed firſt, that Chriſt Ieſus is the Lord by a kind of excellency, the onely, ſole, Ruler, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, and Commander of all. Secondly, we ſhewed it is called a Supper, a Table, whence we gathered this point of Doctrine, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſpirituall Feaſt or Banket whereby our Soules are nouriſhed to eternall life. Now there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16098:25"/>is alſo to be handled a third obſeruation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this firſt title for where the Lord himſelfe doth giue names, there is ſome deepe reach of wiſedome and vnderſtanding in them; Men are but of ſhallow capacitie, they cannot ſound the full depth of things, and therefore the names that are giuen by Men are but ſhallow, and ſuperficiall, they are not much profitable, nor much obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but the Lord that made, and hath ordained all things, he ſees thoroughly into the verie ground, and bottome of all things, and therefore the names that are impoſed by God himſelfe, as they are alwayes verie ſignificant to expreſſe the nature of the things that they are giuen vnto, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are verie pregnant, and plentifull for inſtruction of the Sacrament that we are to ſpeake of. It is tearmed or called by God himſelfe, <hi>The Lords Table,</hi> or <hi>The Lord Supper;</hi> conſider it well and you ſhall find to ariſe a third obſeruation (namely) that the Sacrament which we call the Communion, is by a ſpeciall prerogatiue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, his Sacrament, his Supper, his Table, the Lords Supper, or the Lords Table. In the former obſeruation you heard what it is (namely) that it is called a Supper therefore a Banket. In this obſeruation now you heare whoſe it is, the Lords Supper, or the Lords Banket, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. it is called there by the name of the Lords Table: If you aske why it is the Lords? The Apoſtle ſhewes it cleerely in the ſixteenth <hi>Verſe</hi> (namely) that it is Chriſts, <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16098:26"/>of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we breake, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> It is his Cup, whoſe Blood is communicated in it; but Chriſt his Blood is thereby communicated to vs, and therefore it is Chriſts: It is his Table, of whoſe Meat we feed vpon; but it is Chriſt his Body that there we feed vpon, therefore it is Chriſt his Table, and that by a ſpeciall prerogatiue 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. there it is called by the name of the Lords Supper. And the Apoſtle in the 23 <hi>Verſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> preſently after ſpeaking of the verie ſame Supper, he ſhewes who is the Lord (namely) Ieſus Chriſt, it is his Supper, and by a ſpeciall prerogatiue, it is aſcribed vnto him. Our Sauiour himſelfe affirmes as much with his owne Mouth, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.26.28. where the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is mentioned, in regard of the inſtitution of it, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and ſo the Cup, he ſaith, <hi>This is my Blood.</hi> I haue a ſpeciall intereſt into it, I lay clayme to it, as my right; Chriſt challengeth it for his owne, as if he ſhould ſtep forth and ſay, This is my right, and I challenge it as my owne, by a ſpeciall prerogatiue. For the further opening of this point, we will firſt ſpeake of certaine reſpectiue conſiderations whereby this truth is cleared, and amplyfied; and then of certaine reaſons whereby it is more fully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Firſt, of certaine reſpectiue conſiderations whereby the truth of this obſeruation is cleared and amplyfied: Firſt, in regard of the Suppers of Men, Men haue their Suppers, but they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinarie Suppers, but this is a heauenly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16098:26"/>and ſpirituall Supper, the Supper of Ieſus Chriſt. Secondly, in reſpect of other Suppers that Chriſt himſelfe made, indeed, he made many Suppers while he liued here vpon the Earth; but yet this is his by a kind of ſpeciall prerogatiue, and right, not onely as being his laſt, but the greateſt Supper, of greateſt conſequence he made both to himſelfe and vs; that is to ſay, the Supper of the Lord, was of greateſt conſequence to himſelfe, becauſe preſently that night he was to be betrayed, and deliuered into the hands of ſinners, the next day on the morrow to ſuffer death; and ſo alſo of greateſt conſequence to vs, becauſe it is moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to vs, and we ought to mind it more then all Suppers beſides. A third reſpectiue conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſhall be in regard of thoſe that ſupped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him: It is the Lords Supper, yea, but did not others ſuppe with him? Yes, the Diſciples did: And therefore why may it not be called their Supper? I anſwer, they were but the Gueſts, he the Maſter and the prouider of the Supper; they the Seruants, and he the Lord; though they were with him, though they did partake of it, yet it doth belong to the Lord by a ſpeciall prerogatiue. Laſt of all, in reſpect of the other Perſons of the bleſſed Trinitie, yet ſtill it is his Supper, the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, after a ſpeciall prerogatiue. But you will ſay, was not the Father and the Holy Ghoſt preſent there, and powerfull? Yes, they were in ſome ſence, but yet not by prerogatiue, but it was Chriſts Supper onely by a kind of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prerogatiue, though the Father and the Holy
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16098:27"/>Ghoſt were there preſent and powerfull, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were not incarnate, it was Chriſt alone that was incarnate, and tooke our Fleſh vpon him, and did bodily feed vpon it, and therefore not the Supper of the Father, or of the Holy Ghoſt, but his by a kind of excellencie. Beſides, in the ordinarie vſe of the Sacrament, the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt they are preſent, and powerfull to all ſauing purpoſes as well as the Sonne, yet ſtill Chriſt hath the prerogatiue in this caſe, for whatſoeuer the Father doth in this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, we muſt conceiue he doth it by Chriſt as his Committee; whatſoeuer the Holy Ghoſt doth in making this Supper comfortable to vs, he doth it from Chriſt, as from him being his Deputie; ſo that in effect it is Chriſt that is all in all, it is he to whom this Supper by a ſpeciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue doth belong. Theſe are the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereby the truth of this obſeruation is cleerely amplyfied. Now we will come to the Reaſons whereby it is more fully proued, why is this the Lords Supper by a ſpeciall prerogatiue belonging to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt rather then to any other Perſon.</p>

We know that all Gods buſineſſes, ſpecially Gods
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16098:29"/>worſhip is to be clone with all feare and trembling <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serue the Lord in feare, and reioyce in trembling.</hi> All the parts of Gods worſhip are reuerently to be performed; the greatneſſe of the glorious Maieſtie of God requires it, whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it is; likewiſe, the excellencie of the worke requires it; alſo, the ſtrictneſſe of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God requires it; then againe, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite we looke to receiue by it requires it; yea alſo, our owne voluntarie ſubmiſſion to Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that alſo neceſſarily requires reuerence at our hands; no Man in the World can religiouſly vndertake any part of Gods worſhip without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of due reuerence: Therefore this being a principall part of Gods worſhip, it ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs, and ſtirre vs vp to attaine to all reuerence, humilitie, deuotion, and chriſtian affection that euer we can reach to, in the participation of this Sacrament. The Feaſt of Chriſt, the Supper of Chriſt, and the Table of Chriſt is attributed to him by a kind of excellencie: How ſhould this ſtirre vs vp reuerently to come to him? We know ordinarie manners teacheth vs, that if we be to come to the Table of a great Man, we will looke to our ſelues that our Hands be waſht, and that our Cloathes, our ſpeech, and whole carriage be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and anſwerable to the greatneſſe of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with whom we ſit: Is it ſo amongſt Men? Then for ſhame let Religion teach vs to doe that at the Lords Table, as ordinarie manners teacheth vs to doe at Mens Table, ſeeing it is the Lords Table, let vs looke to our Hands, and Eyes, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16098:29"/>ſpecially and aboue all, let vs obſerue and looke to our Hearts, and ſee that all our actions be well compoſed with due reuerence and deuotion fitting the high Maieſtie of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

True indeed that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt whoſe Sacrament we come to partake of, is not a captious Ruler, as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes of, that ſeekes aduantage at vs; but yet know, that he is a iuſt and a righteous Iudge, a iealous God that cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any miſ-behauiour in his preſence, nor that his Victuals ſhould be waſtfully and riotouſly ſpent, nor his Table abuſed, and therefore come not to the Table of the Lord Ieſus without you be furniſhed with holy ſobrietie, and Chriſtian manners, as becommeth a Gueſt of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.

How much are we bound to Chriſt, that hath vouchſafed vs this fauour, as to admit vs, bid vs, and inuite vs to his owne Table? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.7 <hi>Dauid</hi> had a purpoſe to ſhew ſome fauour and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> for his Fathers ſake, now how would he doe it, but in making him to eat Bread at his Table?

Now to ſtirre vs vp to the performance of this more effectually,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16098:30"/>let vs conſider and obſerue ſome particulars which may be greater ſpurres to ſtirre vs vp to more thankfulneſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, Conſider the excellencie of his Perſon that inuites vs; it is Chriſt himſelfe, the King of Glorie, of Heauen and of Earth, he of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>That thouſand thouſands miniſtred vnto him, and ten thouſand thouſands ſtood before him.</hi> It is he that makes vs his Fellow-gueſts. O what thankfulneſſe doth this require at our hands!</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, Conſider the daintineſſe of the Fare, it is not Bread and water, and cold commons that we are inuited vnto, it is not periſhing Food, but Food that laſteth for euer, euen the Body and Blood of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that he here feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs withall: What leſſe thankfulneſſe then this can we giue to him, then Body for Body, and Blood for Blood?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, Conſider the benefite of this, we receiue not onely temporal comfort, but ſpiritual, as forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, grace, ſanctification, and life eternall; This deſerues therefore eternall thankfulneſſe to be rendred to Chriſt, in our liues and conuerſations.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, Conſider further who we are that are admitted to this Feaſt: Why alas poore baſe wretches, miſerable and damned ſinners, not worth the ground we tread vpon, yet Chriſt admits vs as Gueſts to his Table: We are thoſe ſpoken of, that are poore and hault, blind, lame and naked, we are vagrant Perſons that lye vnder the Hedge, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21, 22. that Chriſt calles and comples to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16098:31"/>come to this Banket. Churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.11. he grudged when <hi>Dauid</hi> came and asked him bread and reliefe in his diſtreſſe: <hi>Shall I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take my Water, and my Bread that I haue prouided for my Shearers, and giue it to them that I know not whence they are?</hi> But the Lord Chriſt, he ſtucke not at a greater matter, but he gaue his owne Body and Blood for vs, he did not onely beſtow vpon vs his Bread and his Wine, poore wretched ſinners, of whom he may more iuſtly ſay, then <hi>Nabal</hi> ſaid of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Goe your wayes, I know you not. The rich Man in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. would not afford poore <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> the crummes that were vnder his Table, but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt affords vs not onely crums, but Meat and Drinke, and the full benefite, honour and comfort of his owne Table, though we be fuller a thouſand times of ſinnes in our Soules, then <hi>Lazarus</hi> was of diſeaſes in his Body, and theſe ſinnes being much more loathſome to God then his diſeaſes was to the rich Man: Yet Chriſt is ſo rich in mercie, that he affords vs not onely the crummes of his Table, but the full benefite of the whole Table, euen to take our fill of the Table. Let vs thinke rightly of this loue, and ſee whether we haue not cauſe to be diſſolued into thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to him for this ſo great loue. To proceed a little further.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fifthly, Conſider the continuall acceſſe that we thorough the mercie of Chriſt, haue to the Lords Table: We are not ſtinted and minted to come at it once in our life time: though I muſt tell you, that there be a great many of poore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16098:31"/>that would giue all that euer they haue that they might come to it as we doe. We are not ſtinted to come once a yeere, though many tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the graceleſſeneſſe of their Hearts, doe come but once: But we thorough Gods mercie, may haue acceſſe to it from month to month, that the conſcionable Receiuer may paſſe from one Communion day to another in the ſtrength of it, if he be carefull to keepe it by Prayer, Meditation and practiſe. So great a bleſſing as this is, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually renewed vnto vs, how ought it to ſtirre vs vp to renew our thankfulneſſe?</p>
            <p n="6">6 Sixthly, Conſider further, whom doth Chriſt ſet vs withall? Euen with his owne Children, thoſe that ſhall be glorified in his heauenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: We poore miſerable wretches, are ſet with them, and fed, and feaſted with them. Is it ſo? How ſhould this ſtirre vs vp to all thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
            <p n="7">7 To proceed a little further in the laſt place: We doe not come to it darkely as many doe, in blindneſſe, darkeneſſe, and ignorance; but the ſame Lord Ieſus Chriſt that prouides this Supper, he prouides vs light to come to it, the light of his Word and inſtruction, that if we be not wilfully blind, we may ſee how to feed, and how to behaue our ſelues, that God may haue the glorie, and we the comfort.</p>

Whoſoeuer ſhall add or detract, not onely from the Word of God, but alſo from the Ordinances of God, they are ſo perfect, that whoſoeuer ſhall do either, they ſhall indanger themſelues to Gods curſe. But herein we muſt put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene matters of Circumſtance, and matters of Subſtance: There are ſome things that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that are to be done vpon paine of damnation, but for thoſe things which he did, and not inſtituted, we may ſuppoſe thoſe to be left to the libertie of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16098:33"/>the Church: As for example, the time that Chriſt inſtituted it, it was at night, that is a Circumſtance, ſhall we thinke therefore that we are bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it then? No. But we ſuppoſe, and that vpon good ground, that Chriſt hath left ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as free to our ſelues, as to himſelfe: But for matter of Subſtance, the things, the matter to be vſed concerning the Bread and Wine, and the words of inſtitution, I ſay theſe things they are to be ſuſpended vpon the authoritie of the Lord Chriſt Ieſus, and not to be altered: nothing is to be changed nor altered, it is part of his Teſtament and Will, wherein he hath bequeathed Legacies to his Church, and therefore it muſt be preciſely kept; yea, the Law of Equitie requires that it ſhould not be altered: And therefore that which Chriſt inſtituted in this, is not to be added too, nor detracted from.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16098:35"/>Blood of Chriſt?</hi> The name that he giues, as you ſee here, in regard of the outward ſigne, is this: he calles it, <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe:</hi> the thing which he doth affirme of it in reſpect of the thing ſignified is, that it is the <hi>Communion of the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> So likewiſe in the latter part of the Verſe, there he ſpeakes concerning the other part of this Sacrament, the Bread: the name that is giuen vnto it in reſpect of the outward ſigne, is, <hi>The Bread which we bleſſe:</hi> and the thing that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes of it, in regard of the ſpirituall and inward grace, is the <hi>Communion of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> The appellations that are here giuen to the outward Elements, Bread and Wine, <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe,</hi> and <hi>the Bread which we breake,</hi> are fit to be handled, among thoſe titles and names, which are proper to the ſeuerall parts of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe they are propounded in indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tearmes, and not vnder any proper name; but as for the thing ſignified, each of them here, as you ſee, being a Communion. <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe, is the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Bread which we breake, is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Body of Chriſt:</hi> each of them be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and both of them one Communion; and therefore this title is giuen in reſpect of the thing ſignified, it falleth out to be handled naturally among thoſe titles common to the whole action of the Sacrament. All is a Communion you ſee. That we may vnderſtand the meaning hereof the better, and ſee how to proceed in it, we will firſt conſider here the occaſion of the words; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16098:36"/>we will ſhew the meaning of the words; thirdly, the manner, how the thing is here affirmed or performed in and by the Sacrament; and fourthly, we will proceed to draw ſome obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as God ſhall giue aſſiſtance. Firſt, concerning the occaſion of theſe words, you muſt vnderſtand that the Apoſtle doth not here profeſſedly and of purpoſe treat of the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as he doth in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, but onely he doth it occaſionally, and as it were by the way: The occaſion was this, Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> that did beleeue, and were conuerted, euen after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, they did ſtill reſide and conuerſe among the reſt of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that were Vnbeleeuers and not conuerted, and thereby had much enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them in many affaires, eſpecially in thoſe two affaires which be moſt principall, and moſt dangerous. Firſt, concerning Marriage: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly concerning religious Feaſts. Concerning their Marriages with them, the Apoſtle hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his Iudgment in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, and directs them to the full, how to carrie themſelues in that buſineſſe, in marrying with Infidels, whereby they might keepe a good conſcience towards God, and to the World. Concerning their religious Feaſts, he deliuers his iudgement in theſe three Chapters, the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, prouing by many reaſons, that it is vtterly vnlawfull for them to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in any religious Feaſt of theirs; one reaſon among the reſt, is drawne from the maine ground of Chriſtian Religion, from the right nature and vſe of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16098:36"/>the ſixteenth to the one and twentieth Verſe, and the Argument ſtands thus, ſaith the Apoſtle to them, You that do profeſſe Chriſtianitie, ſpecially you that haue proceeded ſo farr in it, as to receiue the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, you haue thereby abſolute Communion, you haue giuen your ſelues vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and he hath giuen himſelfe likewiſe to you, you are made one with Chriſt, and he with you, and with all the Faithfull: this is ſet downe in the ſixteenth and ſeuenteenth Verſes. On the other ſide, ſaith he, they that doe communicate in their religious Feaſts, that are conſecrated vnto Idols, they doe giue themſelues ouer vnto thoſe Idols, and make themſelues one with thoſe Idols, &amp; with them that worſhip them. That you heard in the 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 10.20. marke what the Apoſtle inferres vpon it, <hi>It is impoſsible to be one with God, and one with Idols: One with God, and one with Diuels:</hi> For theſe they are no better then Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, it is impoſſible you ſhould be ſo; if once you giue your ſelues to the ſeruice of God, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Diuell; if once you giue your ſelues to the ſeruice of the Diuel, then ye renounce God, and all the Faithfull; We cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and of the Table of Diuels, it is impoſſible that euer you ſhould be ſo: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any caſe partake not with them in any of their religious Feaſts. Thus the Argument ſtands, You that are religious, are made one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with you; and therefore it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ye ſhould communicate and partake in the ſeruice of Idols, or Diuels, and in the Supper of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16098:37"/>the Lord, that is to ſay, it can neuer be done ſo; the ſeruice that ye performe to God in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be acceptable to him: the force of the reaſon ſtands in this, in the proofe of the firſt point, as many as profeſſe Chriſt, beleeuers, and receiuers of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, they haue made themſelues one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them: that is proued in the 16 and 17 Verſes, and for confirmation thereof, he makes them Iudges in it, and he appeales to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſaying, I ſpeake, but vnto them that haue vnderſtanding, Iudge you what I ſay, <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we breaks, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> (As who ſhould ſay) I appeale to your conſciences, you know it is ſo, any Man that knowes what belongs to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, knowes this to be true: So then, there is the occaſion of the words. Now concerning the meaning of the words: He is to expreſſe what is meant by the Communion, and then what is meant by the Body and Blood of Chriſt: The Communion imports in the Originall, either the act of communicating, whereby there is a communion and fellowſhip made; or elſe it imports the Communion it ſelfe, which is made by ſuch an act: As for example, when we ſpeake of a Contract of Marriage, or of a Bargaine, the name may ſignifie, either the act whereby the contract is made, or the contract, or bargaine which is made by ſuch an act: So this Communion ſignifies the contract betweene vs,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16098:37"/>and Chriſt: So then this Communion is of two ſorts, there is a Communion here meant between Chriſt, and the Faithfull; and ſecondly, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Faithfull among themſelues. Firſt, a Communion of Chriſt with the Faithfull, and that is of two ſorts; firſt, a naturall Communion, and then a ſpirituall that we haue together: The naturall Communion that we haue with Chriſt, is in reſpect as he is a Man, and as he doth take our nature vpon him, as he was made Bone of our Bone, and Fleſh of our Fleſh, and this is generall to the whole Race of Man-kind, there is a naturall Communion, betweene Chriſt and the whole Race of Man-kind, yet (notwithſtanding) the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing benefite and comfort of it, is proper to the elect Children of God; and hence it is that this Communion is appropriated to the Children of God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14.16. <hi>For as much then as the Children are partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tooke part with them, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had the power of Death, that is, the Diuel: For he in no ſort tooke on him the Angels nature, but he tooke the Seed of Abraham,</hi> and did communicate in the whole Race of Man-kind, but yet ſo, as onely the Children of God haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereby: This Communion doth ariſe from vs vnto Chriſt: Why? Becauſe our Nature was firſt before Chriſt was incarnate, and he by taking of our Nature vpon him, is made Fleſh of our Fleſh, and Bone of our Bone, and therefore this Communion is from vs to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Communion is a ſpirituall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16098:38"/>as Chriſt is our Head and Mediator, and as we are ingrafted as Members into his myſticall Body; Now this Communion, none are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, nor haue any part in it, but onely the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers; and in this Communion we are made Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone, as in the other he was made Fleſh of our Fleſh, and Bone of our Bone; ſo in the ſpirituall Communion we are made Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of his Fleſh. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. the Apoſtle ſpeakes there of a ſpirituall Communion, betweene Chriſt and the Church: now this Communion ariſeth from him and by him vnto vs, and the other Communion ariſeth from vs to him; for the grace of the Spirit of Life which is in Ieſus Chriſt, is that by which we are ingrafted and incorporated into Chriſt. So then you ſee concerning both the naturall and the ſpirituall Communion that we haue with Chriſt. Then the ſecond Communion, what is it? Why, the Communion that the Faithfull haue among themſelues, whereby they are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, thorough the Bonds of Faith, of Hope, Loue, and the Spirit of God, and all of them made Members of one and the ſame Body, and this Communion ariſeth from the former. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Faithfull among themſelues, ariſeth from the Communion of vs with Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we ioyned together, becauſe all our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers doe agree together from Chriſt our Head. The Apoſtle deliuereth the point, and the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the point together, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Though the Members be many, yet all the Members concurre
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16098:38"/>together in one Body.</hi> That is true, though many Members, yet all of them concurre in one Body, and vnder one Head, and ſo is Chriſt. So ſtands the caſe of the compariſon betweene Chriſt and the Church, there is a Communion betweene Chriſt and the Church, why ſo there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between all that haue fellowſhip one with another, becauſe they concurre &amp; ioyne together vnder one Head. So much ſhall ſerue to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning the Communion: The next thing that is to be vnfolded, is the Body and Blood of Chriſt, that is to ſay, Chriſt wholly, his Body, his Blood, his Death, his Reſurrection, and all his Merits: For howſoeuer it be, that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is tendred vnto vs in the Lords Supper, with an eie and reſpect to his Death on the Croſſe, his Body broken, his Blood ſhed; yet (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) that is not all, we are not to ſtay there, but it hath a further reach; otherwiſe, thoſe that ſtood by our Sauiour Chriſt when he was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, put the caſe that one of them had ſprinkled his Body with the Blood of Chriſt, ſhould he haue had a Communion then with Chriſt? Certainly no. Therefore our Faith muſt reach further, and not ſtay in the Body and Blood of Chriſt, but it muſt reach to the fruit and comfort that comes thereby to ſanctification and eternall life: For ſo Chriſt ſpake. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my Blood which is ſhed for many, for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> Conſider of Chriſt his Death, his Body broken, his Blood ſhed, we muſt haue a further reach to diſcerne the ſauing fruits and benefits of his Death, as forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16098:39"/>of ſinnes, ſanctification, and eternall life. So then we ſee what is meant by the Body and Blood of Chriſt, <hi>The Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the third point to be ſpoken of is, the manner of the performing and accompliſhment of thoſe things in the Sacrament or Supper of the Lord. We muſt vnderſtand it to be thus perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that is to ſay, that this Communion with Chriſt, or the Communion that we haue among our ſelues, we muſt not ſo vnderſtand it, as if it were begun, or made; but ſo performed as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the Sacrament will reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it (that is to ſay) it is there confirmed, ratified, and ſealed vp vnto vs; the Body and Blood of Chriſt is communicated vnto vs, by the way of Seale, of Pledge, of Ratification; the Sacraments doe not beget Faith in vs, but they confirme Faith where it is begotten already, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>After he receiued the ſigne of Circumciſion, as the Seale of the righteouſneſſe of Faith which he had when he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> The Sacrament, that comes and ſeconds it, and ratifies it vnto vs. Then here is the caſe, at our firſt conuerſion, when God gaue vs an effectuall calling, God drawed vs neere to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and worked Faith in vs, and touched our Hearts by his Spirit, and ſo makes this holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion betweene Chriſt and vs, and ſo makes vs one with him, and he with vs. Well, Faith being thus begotten in vs, by the preaching of the Word, the Vnion being thus made, then God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits vs to his Table, to the Sacrament of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16098:39"/>Lords Supper, the point now in hand: He admits vs there, that ſo this Communion, already made betweene Chriſt and vs, might be further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ratified: The Sacrament doth this not as an efficient cauſe, but as an outward inſtrumentall cauſe: It is not done by the deed done, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay, the deed done is not enough to conferre grace, no, it is no ſuch matter, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt: The meanes that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are conuerted by, and effectually called, is the Word, thereby Faith is wrought in them, and a holy Communion made betweene Chriſt and them: after they are admitted to the participation of the Sacrament, by which Sacrament, as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtrumentall cauſe, this Communion, being already begun, and made, is further ratified, and confirmed: This is the meaning of thoſe words, that it is the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt. Now we come to the obſeruations that here ariſeth for our inſtruction: Firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Communion betweene Chriſt and the Faithfull: and then the Communion between the Faithfull and themſelues. The Communion that is betweene Chriſt and the Faithfull, is confirmed vnto vs in the participation of the Lords Supper, that is, it is an effectuall Bond, Pledge, and Seale of that holy and bleſſed Communion, that the Faithfull haue with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them. In <hi>Math.</hi> 26.26. the Text ſaith there, that our Sauiour tooke Bread, and gaue it to his Diſciples, that is, Chriſt communicated himſelfe to vs in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16098:40"/>Sacrament. Now we are to proue that Chriſt communicated himſelfe to vs in the Sacrament: He gaue it to his Diſciples; what freer then the guift? And withall he preſſeth it vpon them, and bids them take, eat, this is my Body: What can be ſpoken more frankly, and more freely? And therefore being ſpoken by him, that neuer ſpake any thing that he meant not in his Heart, it muſt needs be a verie franke and free beſtowing of himſelfe: Yet (as you will ſay) here is Bread, and here is Wine, frankly and freely giuen; but what is this to Chriſt his owne Body? Yes, that Bread, in a Sacramentall ſence, is the Body of Chriſt, he giues the name of the Signe to the thing ſignified; this Bread is his Body; whatſoeuer he ſpeakes and performes concerning the one, he doth concerning the other. He was not ſo franke, free, and liberall in giuing Bread, as he was in giuing his Body to feed vpon: So the like is concerning the Cup, in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27.28. Firſt, here you ſee then, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, in regard of the firſt inſtitution, is a Bond and Seale of the bleſſed Communion that we haue with Chriſt, He gaue himſelfe to vs. In <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.51, 52. there Chriſt tels them, that <hi>He it the liuing Bread which came downe from Heauen, if any Man eat of this Bread, he ſhall liue.</hi> The meaning is, that Chriſt gaue vs his Fleſh to eat ſpiritually. In <hi>Verſ.</hi> 53. it is ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Sonne of Man, and drinke his Blood, ye haue no Communion with Chriſt.</hi> But that which is moſt pregnant for our purpoſe, is in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 56. where it is ſaid, <hi>He that eats my Fleſh, and drinkes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16098:40"/>my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> What neerer Communion can there be then this, that we dwell in him, and he in vs? Who are they that partake of this? <hi>He that eats my Fleſh, and drinkes my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> And is not this his Fleſh eaten, and his Blood drunken? In the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Lords Supper, is ratified the ſweet Communion that is betweene Chriſt and vs. I doe not ſay that that in the ſixth of <hi>Iohn</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood properly of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, but is myſtically applyed to this, of eating Chriſt by Faith, and therefore iuſtly agrees with this, of the Lords Supper, when we meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſts workes in the Sacrament, or out of the Sacrament, not eating his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood after a ſpirituall manner, that is in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall there, if we doe this in the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we doe it in a particular manner: So then it is ſo in all our ſpirituall eating of Chriſt, and drinking of his Blood, we dwell in him, and he in vs, then much more, in the participation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, when our Faith is lift vp to Chriſt, that we feed vpon him, more thoroughly and earneſtly; and therefore much more doth that place take hold of our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Chriſt in the Sacrament, that whoſoeuer eats Chriſt dwelleth in him, and he in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, and haue beene all made to drinke into one Spirit.</hi> The point that the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking of, is this, The Communion that is betweene Chriſt and the Faithfull; He ſhewes firſt the Author of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16098:41"/>it, which is God, <hi>by one Spirit;</hi> and then he ſhewes the Inſtrument to the Signe and Seale, which is the Sacrament, <hi>by one Spirit are we baptized into one Body, whether we be Iewes or Gentiles, bond or free:</hi> then it holds by conſequence in the Lords Supper, yea, that ſeemes plainly to be intimated, where it is ſaid, <hi>hauing beene made all to drinke into one Spirit,</hi> a ſpirituall or a religious drinking, and therefore it is to be vnderſtood (as reſpectiuely) in the Lords Supper, this ſpirituall drinking cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiuely be vnderſtood of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>As often</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as you eat this Bread, and drinke this Cup, you ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> or, ye ſhall ſhew it, that is to ſay, The eating and drinking is a teſtimonie betweene God and you, of a holy Communion ye haue with Chriſt, and what intereſt vnto his Death, that is, that you are partakers of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that is the meaning of it.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16098:43"/>ſo this Communion is made betweene Chriſt and vs; and we know that he is faithfull, and true, and will neuer breake his word: I but in the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper here is a Seale and a Pledge of his loue whereby this Communion is further ratified; when we come there then the Faith which before lay hid in vs, that begins to ſhew it ſelfe by the working of Gods Spirit, and ſo by that meanes we begin to comfort our ſelues, and to be reuiued in our Faith and affiance that we haue in the loue of Chriſt our bleſſed Husband, which is much more then a Ring to reuiue a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the loue of her Husband, becauſe here are the words vſed againe of the renewing of our Communion, <hi>This is my Body that was broken for thee, &amp;c. This is my Blood that was ſhed for thee, &amp;c.</hi> The words are moſt powerfull and fit to reuiue vs in the loue and affiance that we haue in Chriſt our Husband, this makes all quiet and ſure; and to conclude, though Chriſt be abſent from me, yet ſurely I know he continues one and the ſame, and this comforts me: we know we make vſe of this in our ordinarie ſpeech, if any be married, we vſually ſay, <hi>God giue you Ioy.</hi> It is well, oh that there were Hearts in Men to beleeue and ſee, and that they had practice and experience of this to ſee that at the Lords Table we be hand-faſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, then God would giue vs much ioy and comfort.</p>
            <p>Another matter of Inſtruction is this: That when we are at the Lords Table, there is a nearer Bond now betweene Chriſt and vs then there was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16098:43"/>before; here is a neerer Bond, at leaſt we are more neerer ſealed and tyed to Chriſt, and he to vs, then before: And why? Becauſe it is the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, it is further ratified, ſealed, and confirmed; and therefore it is matter of ſingular comfort to Gods Children in that it pleaſeth God to vouchſafe vs ſo much fauour as to be one with him: To be one with a great Man, with the Princes of the World, we eſteeme it a great matter: but what is it to haue Communion with Chriſt the Sonne of God? He to be made one with vs, and we with him? This as it is matter of great comfort, ſo alſo it is matter of obedience, to ſtirre vs vp to obedience. Is it ſo that we haue beene at the Lords Table, to haue our Communion renewed? Then we ſhould carie our ſelues worthy of this mercie. Are we made Members of Chriſt? Then take heed that thou doſt not take the faculties and powers of thy Soule and Body, and abuſe them to ſinne, iniquitie, and to vncleaneneſſe. It is the rule of the Apoſtle: We muſt conſider with our ſelues, I haue beene at the Lords Table, and made a Member of Chriſt, and therefore now I muſt looke better to my Tongue that I doe not ſweare nor blaſpheme, nor vſe no vaine nor idle ſpeeches; that I muſt now looke better to my Eyes, that I doe not ſuffer them to be light and wanton Eyes; and ſpecially to looke better to my Heart, to walke with Chriſt, becauſe he is one with me, and I one with him.</p>
            <p>Another point of Inſtruction teacheth vs, that Chriſt is really deliuered vnto vs in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16098:44"/>but yet notwithſtanding ſpiritually: but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Bread is the Communion of his Body, and the Wine the Communion of his Blood: that is to ſay, there is a reall Communion to euerie faithfull and ſpirituall Receiuer; for as the Spirit of God workes Faith in our Hearts, ſo Faith cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to beleeue that Chriſt hath made our peace with God, and that we are incorporate into his Body, and made one with him. This is the reall exhibiting of Chriſt in the Sacrament, there is no tranſubſtantiation that the Bread is turned into the Body of Chriſt, no, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> A plaine expoſition of Chriſt himſelfe, where he ſaith, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that is to ſay, It is a Communion of his Body. But if this be ſuch a Communion, then ſay they, the Bread muſt be turned into the Body of Chriſt. I anſwer, neither of theſe, for the Communion is ſpirituall, it cannot be a corporall Communion, but a ſpirituall Communion, there is ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as is made here betweene the Diuell and them, that worſhip the Diuell which is not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſubſtance, that is nothing elſe but a testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that they will ſerue him, worſhip, and obey him. So our Communion is a ratification that we beleeue in our Hearts that Chriſt is one with vs, and we with him. True, we are made partakers of Chriſt wholly, of his Death, and of his Merits, but ſtill in a ſpirituall manner. As for his Body, we haue nothing to doe with it, that is in Heauen. And therefore they that ſay, they eat his Body, they are as groſſe, as thoſe in the ſixth of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:16098:44"/>It is an abſurd thing, nay, it is a horrible thing, for any Man to thinke that they ſhould eat the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are now to make digreſſion into the matter of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſo according as we began, to pay our monthly tole, as it were to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in preparing our ſelues to a worthy receiuing of the Sacrament of his bleſſed Body and Blood, that ſo we may be fitted to come, with glorie to God, and comfort to our owne Soules. The third name: It is called a Communion, as you haue heard out of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle entends a double Communion: One, that the Faithfull haue with Chriſt their Head: Another,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16098:47"/>which the Faithfull haue amongſt themſelues. That which we haue with Chriſt, is double, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Spirituall: Naturall, and that is by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, as he is Man; and this Communion, is common to all Men, but yet the ſauing benefite of it reacheth onely to the Faithfull, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For as much therefore as the Children were partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelfe tooke part with them, that he might deſtroy thorough Death, him that had the power of Death, that is, the Diuell.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Communion is from Chriſt our Head to vs by grace: The Naturall Communion is from vs to Chriſt. The Spirituall Communion, is from Chriſt to vs: In the former he is made Bone of our Bone, and Fleſh of our Fleſh; In the latter, we are made Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of his Fleſh: as in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. <hi>For we are Members of his Body, of his his Fleſh, and of his Bones.</hi> The ſecond Communion is of the Faithfull amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and this ſtands in Faith, and Hope, and Loue, and this proceeds from the firſt: for therefore the Faithfull are knit together amongſt themſelues as Members, becauſe they are firſt knit to Chriſt their Head. We haue ſpoken of the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion already ſo farre as it concernes this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now we come to the ſecond Communion which the Faithfull haue amongſt themſelues. And that we may proceed vpon a good and ſure ground, we muſt firſt ſee, that this ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is here entended by the Apoſtle as well as the former: For howſoeuer the word Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be indifferently vnderſtood of each; as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16098:47"/>well the Communion which the Faithfull haue amongſt themſelues, as of that which they haue with Chriſt, yet if the Apoſtle doth not here ſo intend it, wharſoeuer we ſhall ſpeake of it, though happely true, and fit for the Argument in hand, yet it may iuſtly be diſtaſted, as not ſeaſonable, becauſe it is not pertinent to this place: but when we plainly ſee that it is part of the Apoſtles reach to ſhew that the Lords Supper is a Communion of the Faithfull amongſt themſelues, wee ſhall much better reliſh and digeſt thoſe Doctrines which ſhall be rayſed from it. Now that ſuch is the entendment of the Apoſtle, it appeares thus: He ſaith in <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. <hi>The Bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> And ſo proceeds and ſaith, <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. <hi>For we that are many are one Bread and one Body, becauſe we all are partakers of one Bread.</hi> Where you ſee it is an next to the former by way of reaſon: Now ye know that the reaſon muſt be anſwerable in ſence to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that is thereby confirmed: Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we will make the Apoſtle to ſpeake abſurdly, and without ſence to ſet downe the propoſition of one thing, and to render the reaſon of an other: It muſt needs be granted, that looke what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion he ſpeakes of in the reaſon, <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. the ſame Communion he ſpeakes of in the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. and ſo on the contrarie, looke what Communion he ſpeakes of in <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. the ſame he ſpeakes of in the 17, but in <hi>Verſe</hi> 17 he ſpeakes expreſly and diſtinctly of the ſecond Communion as well as of the firſt, for when he ſaith in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16098:48"/>latter part of <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. <hi>We are all one Bread,</hi> there is our Communion with Chriſt: And in the former part, <hi>We that are many are one Bread and one Body,</hi> there is the Communion which we haue amongſt our ſelues: And marke, the latter part containes the cauſe of the former, and is rendred as a reaſon of it, <hi>becauſe we are all partakers of one Bread:</hi> ſhewing not only that there is ſuch a Communion amongſt themſelues, in and by the vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; but alſo how it is effected, namely, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all partake of one Chriſt,</hi> that thorough the Communion which euery one hath thereby in the Body and Blood of Chriſt, they haue alſo a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion amongſt themſelues: And for further confirmation hereof, he giues inſtance in two caſes of like nature, one in <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. <hi>Iſrael which is after the Fleſh, are not they which eat of the Sacrifices, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Altar?</hi> As who ſhould ſay, It is ſo with thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that ſtill obſerue the carnall Rites (as the Apoſtle elſe-where calles them) that communicate together in their ſeruice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo doe you in yours. The other inſtance is in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20.21. It is ſo with the worſhippers of Idols, they thereby partake and haue communion and fellowſhip one with an other: For the verie ſame word which is in <hi>Verſes</hi> 18 and 20. <hi>partakers,</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> is the ſame in the Originall with that in <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. <hi>communion.</hi> Now then if <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, that ſtill obſerue their carnall Rites, and if Idolaters, if they in their ſeruice and worſhip haue communion and fellowſhip one with another, as well as with their Idols, then much more haue we
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16098:48"/>(ſaith the Apoſtle) in the Lords Supper. We haue a Communion amongſt our ſelues as well as with Chriſt our Head, which in all theſe are to be vnderſtood ſtill with this limitation, that it is not then made, but there it is teſtified and profeſſed to each other, and to the World, and nouriſhed and confirmed to our ſelues. This point being thus cleared, and the way made open and plaine before vs, now we are to enter vpon ſuch Doctrines and obſeruations as naturally ariſeth from hence.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Seeing the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a Communion of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full one with another, the obſeruation is this: That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is a publike Teſtification, a comfortable Nurſe, a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Bond, and a ſure confirmation of that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Communion which the Faithfull haue amongſt themſelues: Or to ſpeake more briefely, and yet more plainly; It is the Sacrament of Loue and Amitie amongſt Gods children: This point is to be proued: See it in the Shadow in the Sacrament of the Old Teſtament, which ſtands in correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie and anſwers to this of the New, that is the Paſſeouer, and hereby we ſhall ſee, not onely that theirs in Chriſt is as ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. but alſo ſo long as euer this Sacrament hath had any being either in the Subſtance, or in the Shadow, it hath alwaies beene of this verie nature and vſe here propounded. Conſider the Lords inſtitution of the Paſſeouer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. and there we ſhall find many Ceremonies and circumſtances tending to this end, tending to ſhew and to nouriſh a louing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16098:49"/>Communion amongſt the Receiuers: Firſt, All were to communicate in it, as we may ſee <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3.6.47. Ioynt actions are alwayes entended to be performed with Ioynt affections. Secondly, ſaith the Text, if any did otherwiſe, <hi>He ſhould be cut off, Verſ.</hi> 15 and 19. that is, whoſoeuer doth diſſent, and not louingly communicate with all the reſt in this buſineſſe, ſhould haue no part nor benefit in or by it. Thirdly, it was to be eaten in one Houſe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 46. the oneneſſe of the Houſe and place where it was eaten, teſtifies the oneneſſe of the Hearts &amp; affections of them that eat it: for where thoſe of a Family are at iarres, and diſſentions, and diuiſions, one Houſe will not hold them. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If his Houſe were too little for the Lambe, he was to call in his next Neighbour, as in <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. a pregnant teſtimonie of loue and good will as can be. Fifthly, It was to be done at one and the ſame time, the ſame month, the ſame day, the ſame houre, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2, 3, 6, 8. their generall conſenting in the time arguing the generall conſenting of their Minds and Hearts: And what time was that? Euen the Euening, when they were all in their cold Blood; the iniuries and offences of the day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and forgiuen (for the Sunne muſt not goe downe vpon our wrath) when their affections were as calme and quiet as the Euening, then they were to receiue it. Sixthly, they were all to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in it by one Law, <hi>Verſe</hi> 49. though it were a Stranger, yet there was but one Law for both, all of them louingly ſubmitting themſelues vnder the ſame Law, and ſweetly conſenting together to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16098:49"/>goe all by one and the ſame direction. Laſtly, It muſt be eaten without Leauen, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8, 15, 19. what that is in the Letter, all of vs know by our owne experience: But what is the true and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſence of it? That let the Apoſtle tell you in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>Let vs keepe the Feaſt not with old Leauen, neither in the leauen of maliciouſneſſe and wickedneſſe.</hi> It is the Leauen of maliciouſneſſe which aboue all Leauen is to be purged out; Loue and charitie being ſpecially confirmed to vs in this action. Thus we haue ſeene it in the Inſtitution: Now let vs conſider it in the Reſtitution by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.3, 5. when the Paſſeouer had beene a long time intermitted, for it ſaith, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. they had not kept it of a great time: There are many teſtifications of a louing Communion amongſt them; from the firſt Verſe to the ſixth we ſee, all the People were to come together, into the ſame place, at the ſame time, to keepe one and the ſame Paſſeouer, and that with this ſpeciall obſeruation, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. that when they could not keepe it the firſt Month as the Law required, for want of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient aſſembly, they put it off till the ſecond Month: <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12, 13. It is expreſly noted that all <hi>Iudah</hi> came with one Heart, a very great aſſembly, howſoeuer there were many Recuſants in <hi>Ephraim Verſe</hi> 10. as there be too many now a dayes: And ſo it was done with great Ioy, <hi>Verſe</hi> 21. and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the obſeruation of the Feaſt, keeping it other ſeuen dayes, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22, 23. All which are plaine reſtifications with what a louing and cheerefull Communion they performed this ſeruice. So in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16098:50"/>the ſeconding of this Reſtitution by <hi>Ioſiah;</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35. from the firſt Verſe to the eighteenth, there we may ſee, ſuch willing contribution by King and Princes, ſuch a generall aſſiſtance of Prieſts and Leuites, ſuch a great concourſe of People from all <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſuch a great aſſembly, as that there was no Paſſeouer kept like that ſince the dayes of <hi>Samuel.</hi> All liuely witneſſes, as of their zeale for Gods glorie, ſo of a moſt louing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion amongſt themſelues. If it be ſo in the Shadow, what is it in the Subſtance? If the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer be a Sacrament of Loue and Amitie, then the Lords Supper is ſo much more? See it therefore ſecondly in the Subſtance, <hi>The Lords Supper, Iohn</hi> 13.4. to the 15. Our Sauiour being to ordaine this Sacrament, doth firſt teach them by his example, a Leſſon of Loue, he waſheth his Diſciples Feet: teaching them that they muſt ſo loue one another, as that they refuſe no ſeruile office for the good of their Brethren, though it be the waſhing of their Feet. And after the Inſtitution, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 34, 35. he preſſeth vpon them his Commandement of Loue, as his chiefe Commandement, and their chiefe dutie to God. Marke this, it is as if he had ſaid, I will now haue you to receiue the Sacrament of my Supper: Well before you receiue it, that you may know it to be a Sacrament of Loue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and a Bond or Pledge of your ſpirituall Communion one with another, I giue you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Loue to ſeaſon your Hearts withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand: And that you may continually ſo eſteeme and remember it, I will charge you with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16098:50"/>my Commandement of Loue in a ſpeciall manner. He prepared them with an example of Loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and after giues them a Commandement of Loue, to teach them that this Sacrament is a Communion of Loue. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle being to redreſſe ſuch abuſes and corruptions in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as had crept into this Sacrament, doth ſpecially tax thoſe that are againſt this duty of Loue, <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. diſſentions, <hi>Ver.</hi> 21, 22. eating and drinking aſunder, <hi>Verſe</hi> 33. not tarrying one for another. The Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. had called this Sacrament a Communion, now all theſe practiſes are directly oppoſite to a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; theſe are breaches and ſeparations, and therfore if euer they will celebrate this Sacrament aright, according to the will of God, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament, and for their owne good, it muſt be done with all the offices of Loue that may be.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16098:53"/>be acceptable to God, and profitable and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thy ſelfe. There be many Reaſons to ſtirre vs vp to this dutie: We come to the Lords Table to receiue a Pledge and Pawne of Gods Loue in Chriſt; the Bread and Wine are Pledges of the ſame; therefore we muſt come in loue; we come to haue our Faith confirmed and encreaſed, how can this be without Loue? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>If I had all Faith, and not Loue, I were nothing.</hi> If we want Loue, all is nothing: ſo we come there to ioyne with the Congregation in Prayer: If we pray without Loue, in wrath and hatred, it is damnable, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. Againe, we come to receiue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of our ſinnes at Gods Hand, then we muſt forgiue one another, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.15. <hi>If you doe not forgiue Men their treſpaſſes, no more will your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue you your treſpaſſes.</hi> Beſides, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Seale that depends vpon the Word; but we cannot profit by the Word without Loue. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.20. <hi>The wrath of Man doth not accompliſh the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> That is, when Men are of a wrathfull and filthy diſpoſition, the Seed of the Word will not grow in their Hearts. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all maliciouſneſſe, and all guile, and enuy, &amp;c. As new-borne Babes deſire the ſincere Milke of the Word that ye may grow thereby.</hi> If we cannot profit by the Writings without Loue, then we cannot profit by the Seale which depends vpon them, without Loue. Therefore we muſt bring Loue with vs to this Sacrament, and reſolue to maintaine it, and not breake it for any thing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for trifles. But ſome will ſay, I would faine
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16098:54"/>be friends, but he that is falne out with me, will not be reconciled. Well, what then? Haſt thou tendred it <hi>bona fide,</hi> and doſt thou deſire it heartily? And doſt thou for thine owne part forgiue freely? Doſt thou pray that God would turne his Heart? And doſt thou take all opportunities, and vſe all good meanes to draw him to it? And art thou willing to humble and diſparage thy ſelfe rather then fayle? And art ready to embrace him vpon any lawfull conditions that thou mayſt win him? And doſt thou doe all this for Gods cauſe, that he may be honoured and ſerued, and thy Brother cured, and thy ſelfe in better caſe to doe thy duty? Why then though he be at variance with thee, yet thou art at peace and vnitie with him: the ſinne is his, and not thine. I, but what if I haue done thus, and haue beene reconciled to him, and he breakes forth againe, muſt I ſeeke to him againe, I cannot yeeld to this? Yes, thou muſt doe it againe: our Sauiour teacheth vs that we muſt doe this ſeuen times, yea, ſeuentie times ſeuen times, though it be neuer ſo oft thou muſt ſeeke reconcilement, and not let this hinder thee from the Lords Table. I but what if I cannot parley with him by reaſon of the diſtance of place, or elſe he is a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great place? I anſwer, thou muſt vſe either a Letter or Meſſenger to him, if conueniently thou mayſt; if not, diſcharge thy ſelfe cleerely before the Lord; and if it be a knowne iarre, then tell them of it that are chiefely acquainted with it, and make profeſſion that thou wouldeſt faine be reconciled, and this will diſcharge thee. I but
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16098:54"/>what if I cannot diſpence with my owne Heart? I grant it is my ſinne, yet I cannot be at peace with him. Well, then thou canſt not be ſaued: If thy Heart be ſo hardned againſt thy Brother that it cannot forgiue him, aſſuredly the Lord may iuſtly and will harden himſelfe againſt thee. But whether am I in ſuch a caſe to come or to forbeare? Many will come and aske this queſtion of the Miniſter, and it is a captious queſtion to him: For if he ſay, Come, then it hardens them in their mallice: If he ſay, Forbeare, then he hardens them in their profaneſſe: Each way is a double notorious ſinne; but in the meane time it is a fooliſh and ſenceleſſe queſtion to them: For whether they doe come, or whether they doe forbeare, being in that caſe, they cannot be ſaued; for thou haſt no part in theſe buſineſſes: None of Gods Ordinances will ſaue vs vnleſſe we ſubmit our ſelues to them, we can tell you no other way to Heauen, then God hath told vs; therefore if you beleeue it, and be aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by it, well, and good; but if thou wilt none of God (in being ruled by him) he will none of thee. But our anſwer is this, that ſurely of both theſe euils, it is beſt that ſuch a one forbeare to come at all: Nay I tell you, if any ſhould offer to come in this caſe, if we knew it, we would forbid them; they haue no right to this Sacrament, and therefore are not to be admitted by the Miniſter; their forbearance is but hurt to themſelues; their comming is an offence to the Church. But they will ſay, how ſhall we doe? Why, if thou canſt not be fitted to come, thou muſt not come; if
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16098:55"/>thou wilt liue in thy ſinne, and rather goe to Hell then forgiue thy Brother, then thou muſt dye in thy ſinne. The point is this, we muſt pull downe our proud Hearts, and caſt out this Leauen of maliciouſneſſe which makes vs vnfit to receiue any good by this Sacrament, or by any of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. But what if I haue laboured to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power, and yet cannot quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my wretched corruption, but that ſtill I haue ſome grudge left within me? I anſwer, there is none that labour ſo, but they find ſome effect of it in themſelues: if therefore thou find ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in thee, and art grieued that there is no more; and if thou doſt continue in thy labour, and care, and ſtriuing, euen to the verie death, thorough Chriſt Ieſus thy infirmities ſhall be pardoned and cured, and thou ſhalt be a fit Gueſt for the Lords Table. But for Chriſts ſake deceiue not thy ſelfe, ſaying or thinking thou haſt ſtriuen thy beſt, when thou haſt done little or nothing at all: For if thou haſt ſtriuen as thou oughteſt, thou ſhalt find ſome effect of it. It is a commendable thing therefore, that Children and Seruants ſhould make meanes to their Parents and Maſters for the forgiueneſſe of their offences which they haue committed againſt them, with this caution, that it be not done for forme or faſhion, but with a purpoſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour not to offend ſo againe. But this is not all, for I would haue Men know, that it is not enough to be at peace with Men when they come to the Lords Table; but this dutie of Loue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe to the whole ſecond Table; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16098:55"/>therefore it is not enough onely not to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but if thou faileſt in any other dutie of the ſecond Table, thou wanteſt this Loue; though thou haſt no malice in thy Heart, yet if thou beeſt a diſhonourer of Parents, a Theefe, or a Lyer, &amp;c. thou fayleſt in this dutie: And therefore when I bid you come in Loue, I meane that you ſhould ſo loue your Neighbours, that you ſhould ſeeke both in thought, word, and deed to aduance them and their eſtate as your owne.</p>

The firſt of thoſe Heads whereunto wee did reduce this Doctrine of the Lords Supper, were the names and titles that were giuen to it: and ſome of them we ſhewed were more common to the whole action; and ſome more proper to the parts of it: We began with thoſe which were more common to the whole action, wherein we are to proceed. Firſt, It is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16098:57"/>called, The Lords Table: Secondly, The Lords Supper: Thirdly, The Communion: Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the fourth title which is giuen to it, and that is, The New Teſtament: For ſo it is called by our Sauiour himſelfe in the firſt inſtitution of it, as it is reported by three ſeuerall Euangeliſts, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament. Marke</hi> 14.24. There is the ſame words. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. <hi>This Cup is that New Teſtament in my Blood.</hi> And the teſtimonie of theſe three Euangeliſts, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with the after-witneſſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood.</hi> All concurre together verie plainly, calling this Sacrament, The New Teſtament. <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> ſpeake plaine enough that he ſpake it of the Cup; for ſo the courſe of the Text directly entends, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Marke</hi> 14.23. <hi>Alſo he tooke the Cup, &amp;c.</hi> that is plaine enough. But <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake more pregnantly and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood:</hi> they name the Cup. If we will rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and apply this truth, we muſt receiue it with theſe cautions: Firſt, whereas it is ſpoken of the Cup, it is to be vnderſtood of the Wine in the Cup: Secondly, whereas it is affirmed onely of the Wine, that that is the New Teſtament, it is to be vnderſtood of the Bread alſo: Thirdly, wee muſt not ſet it on the Racke, and ſtretch it further then the nature of a Sacrament will beare it. Firſt, howſoeuer it be ſaid the Cup by name, yet it is to be vnderſtood of the Wine in the Cup, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie figuratiue ſpeech whereby the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16098:57"/>is ſignified by the name of the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining: I will giue you an inſtance of the verie ſame nature, time, and place, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.17, 18. <hi>And he tooke the Cup, and gaue thankes, and ſaid, Take this and diuide it among you.</hi> Our Sauiour ſitting at the Paſſeouer with his Diſciples, giues them the Cup, and bids them diuide it amongſt them: What, the materiall Cup? No, but the Wine in the Cup. It is the fruit of the Vine, the Wine they were to drinke of, as <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. <hi>I will not drinke of the fruit of the Vine, &amp;c.</hi> And ſurely it holds by proportion to the Bread in the Sacrament: For of the Bread it is ſaid, <hi>This is my Body, Math.</hi> 26.26. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which he ſaith of, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> muſt needs be the Wine. Secondly, howſoeuer it is ſpoken of the Cup onely by name, yet it is enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded proportionally of the Bread, and ſo of the whole Sacrament: For both kinds make but one Sacrament; and therefore the Bread being as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall a part of the Sacrament as the Wine, looke whatſoeuer is aſcribed, or whatſoeuer bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ariſeth by the Wine, the ſame alſo is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the Bread; and whoſoeuer ſhall make the Cup the New Teſtament, and not the Bread, doth thereby as much as in him lyes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder the Body of Chriſt from his Blood, and ſo diſanull this whole Teſtament. Thirdly, the ſpeech is not to be ſet on the Racke, and ſtretched further then the nature of a Sacrament will beare, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> Not that it is ſo in it ſelfe, it is not meant that that is the ſubſtance of the Teſtament it ſelfe, but onely Sacramentally
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16098:58"/>according to the entendment of ſpeeches in the like kind in all other Sacraments, that is, This is the Pledge and Seale of the New Teſtament. That we may carrie the buſineſſe wholly and plainly before vs, whereas there be foure witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this Truth, it is needfull and profitable for vs to compare all theſe teſtimonies together; for by this meanes if there be any ſeeming difference betwixt them, they ſhall be accorded, and ſo the Scripture ſhall bee iuſtified from contradiction. Secondly, ſo that which is defectiue in the one, ſhall be ſupplyed in the other. Thirdly, ſo ſhall we be more fully perſwaded of the truth hereof, being confirmed out of the mouth of many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and ſo we ſhall vnderſtand the whole mind of God touching this buſineſſe. And becauſe the Euangeliſt <hi>Mathew</hi> is more copious then any of the other, his teſtimonie ſhall be the rule that we will compare &amp; reduce the reſt vnto, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, that is ſhed for many for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> This, that is this Cup, or this Wine, or this Sacrament (as we heard the meaning was before) and herein they all agree, <hi>Is my Blood,</hi> which if it be groſſely and carnally to be vnderſtood, as the <hi>Capernaits</hi> did vnderſtand it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.51. and as the Papiſts doe in this verie caſe, it is impoſſible in euerie Mans vnderſtanding, that Chriſt ſhould giue them his Blood whileſt he was aliue: but if it were poſſible, yet the ſpeech is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the action ſauage both on his part and theirs, that he ſhould poure out the Blood of his owne Body into the Cup, and they ſhould drinke

But vnderſtand it as he meant it, ſpiritually and ſacramentally, then it is full of comfort, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> that is, the Signe, and Seale, and Pledge of my Blood: as if he ſhould haue ſaid to them, If ye drinke of this Wine, and withall lift vp your Hearts, and haue Faith in my Blood, the Wine ſhall be (thorough Gods ordinance, and the liuely operation of the Holy Ghoſt) as effectuall to you to all ſauing purpoſes, as if my owne Blood were as naturally or certainly in you as in my ſelfe, The New Teſtament, which is ſpoken in oppoſition to the former Teſtament. There was a Teſtament before, but that is old, this is new: and there was Blood before, but that was of Beaſts and Birds, this is of himſelfe: <hi>My Blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> Here is ſome ſeeming difference betwixt them, <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> agree, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament; Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> differ from them, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. <hi>This is the New Teſtament in my Blood;</hi> This is onely in the manner of the ſpeech, not in the meaning; the ioynt entendment of them all, is to ſhew that this Blood is proper and peculiar to the New Teſtament, in reſpect of the full exhibition of it, whereby it is ordained, ratified, and confirmed, and wherein the whole force and power of the New Teſtament conſiſts; as the former Teſtament was by the Blood of Buls
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16098:59"/>and Goats, ſo this is by the Blood of Chriſt: and this we may ſee <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.10, <hi>&amp;c. This is the Blood of the Teſtament which God hath appointed to you.</hi> And hereto anſwers the ſpeech of <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke, This is my Blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for you;</hi> and in <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. the Apoſtle ſaith, The Old Teſtament was not ordained without Blood; and ſo alſo the New Teſtament is not ordained without Blood: So we ſee that though the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes differ in words, yet their meaning is one and the ſame, <hi>which is ſhed.</hi> It was not then actually ſhed, yet it was effectuall then and alwayes from the beginning: <hi>It was the Blood of the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the World.</hi> Times breake no ſquare with God, for there is no difference of times with him at all. This is added purpoſely to ſhew, that it is not ſimply the Blood of Chriſt that ſaues vs, but his Blood ſhed: And that when we come to the Lords Table, we come not to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his Incarnation ſo much, whereby he tooke our Blood on him; but his Death, whereby he ſhed his Blood for vs, and for many: It is not for all the World in generall, as ſome fooliſhly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine; but it is reſtrayned to ſome: nor yet it is not limited to the Diſciples onely, nor yet to the Iewes onely, as the former Teſtament was; but to many. If you will know who this many is, looke into the firſt of <hi>Iohn, To as many as receiued him, To as many as beleeue in his Name,</hi> euen to the whole many of the World that receiue Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in his Name; <hi>Of all Nations ſome.</hi> The Euangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> add one thing further,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16098:59"/>
               <hi>Which is ſhed for you:</hi> Which is not meant of the Diſciples onely, but for the whole Church; for the benefit of all the Faithfull: And it giues vs further to vnderſtand, that whoſoeuer comes to the Lords Table, muſt receiue particularly for himſelfe, as if Chriſt were there preſent, and ſhould ſay vnto them, This is for you, and for you. Laſtly, For the remiſſion of ſinnes: there is the benefit of it. I but (will ſome ſay) haue we no other benefit by it? Haue we not our Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and our Iuſtification, &amp;c. by the ſhedding of Chriſts Blood? Yes ſurely, but that is ſet downe for all the reſt. I but haue I not remiſſion of ſinnes by his Body as well as by his Blood? Yes ſurely, but it is rather ſaid ſo of his Blood, becauſe of the Sacrifices of the Law, which were a Type of Chriſts Sacrifice, and were offered by Blood. Secondly, howſoeuer his Body is auaileable to remiſſion of ſinnes, yet it is ſo farre forth, as it is crucified, and his Blood ſhed: and thus we are to conceiue of theſe things. Now we come to the points of Doctrine and Inſtruction that ariſe from hence. The firſt thing that our Sauiour ſpeakes of is the New Teſtament, that is the ground of all.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> The point we obſerue from hence is this: The ſtate of all the Faithfull, that haue liued, or doe liue, or ſhall liue, from the death of Chriſt to the Worlds end, doth ſtand and hold by a new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Couenant betwixt God and them: Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Couenant are not all one amongſt Men, but in matters of Grace and Saluation betwixt God and Man, they are all one: Gods Couenant is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16098:60"/>his Teſtament, and his Teſtament is his Couenant. Circumciſion, though it were a bare Couenant, not ratified by the death of the Teſtator, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore properly no Teſtament, yet it is called a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.8. All the intereſt that euer any Man had in the free grace and ſaluation of God, they had it meerely by force and vertue of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant: For Man hauing nothing but what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues from God, he can haue no aſſurance to, nor any good by any thing, but what he hath by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant from God: Hence it is that God hath all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes manifeſted his good will to Man by way of Couenant: thus he dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. and ſo after his fall, 3.17. and ſo to <hi>Noah</hi> after the Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.9. and to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.2. &amp; ſo to the <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 19.5. &amp; ſo it is now to vs that liue vnder the Goſpell, the matter of Saluation ſtands by vertue of a new Couenant, which being ſealed by the actuall Blood-ſhedding of our Sauiour Chriſt, is moſt properly a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſo our ſtate vnder the Goſpell is the ſtate of a new Teſtament: in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. there it is plainly affirmed that it is ſo, <hi>At ſundry times, and in diuers manners God ſpake in the old time, to our Fathers by the Prophets, in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken vnto vs by his Sonne, who hath by himſelfe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our ſinnes.</hi> The Apoſtle compares the ſtate of the Faithfull that liued in former times, to ours that liue vnder the Goſpell: <hi>At ſundry times God appeared, &amp;c.</hi> at the beginning to <hi>Adam,</hi> after to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in diuers manners,</hi> to ſome by Angels, to ſome by Viſions, to ſome by Shadows,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16098:60"/>by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: <hi>but to vs by his owne Sonne,</hi> he hath manifeſted his Couenant to vs by his Sonne, <hi>who hath by himſelfe purged our ſinnes,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, He had ſent a new Couenant-maker to vs, and he had made a new and another Couenant with vs, and what is that? Remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there it is figured that it ſhould be ſo: <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Sonnes, <hi>Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi> by which two other things are meant, ſaith the Apoſtle, the two Teſtaments, the former is ſignified by <hi>Agar,</hi> and what is her condition? Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh and in bondage. <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> what is he? Slauiſh and in bondage too, and borne after the Fleſh. Here is the former Teſtament, a ſlauiſh Teſtament that tyed Men to great bondage, ſpecially in the Ceremonies, her Children were the Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, that is, as many as did not ſpiritually embrace it, that did not ſpell the Couenant of Grace vnder the Couenant of Workes, it was to them meerely a carnall Couenant, and they carnall Children. The latter Teſtament is ſignified by <hi>Ieruſalem, Verſe</hi> 26. and what is her condition? Aboue and free. What are her Children? As <hi>Iſaack.</hi> And what is their condition? Not after the Fleſh, but after the Promiſe. Therefore we, ſaith the Apoſtle, that is to ſay, we that liue vnder the Goſpell or New Teſtament, are after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> Children of the Promiſe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 28. as if he ſhould ſay, we are deliuered by Chriſt, from that ſlauerie of Ceremonies, and from that carnall ſeruice, which was a Veile to them, they did not ſee that which was hidden vnder it, we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16098:61"/>are free from their bondage, we hold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not after the Fleſh. In <hi>Ieremie</hi> 31.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is promiſed, it ſhall be ſo, <hi>Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Couenant with the Houſe of Iudah and of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> where it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called a new Couenant, and with whom it is made, <hi>with the Houſe of Iudah and of Iſrael,</hi> that is to ſay, with the Church vnder the Goſpell, for they are the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the right <hi>Iewes,</hi> that are <hi>Iewes</hi> within, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, and there is ſet downe the ſubſtance of the Couenant, and the parts of it, Sanctification and Iuſtification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by putting his Law in their Hearts, <hi>Verſe</hi> 32, 33.

And that we may know certainely, that theſe dayes there ſpoken of, are the dayes of the Goſpell after Chriſts death, the Apoſtle himſelfe ſo expounds it, and applyes it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.8. and 10.16, 17. and in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. there it is performed and made good, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is ſhed for you: For you?</hi> That is to ſay, As many as liuing vnder the New Teſtament doe embrace it: the originall Text is verie ſignificant.

We that now liue are not vnder the Old Teſtament, but vnder the New: for that which is there ſpoken to the <hi>Romanes</hi> is entended generally to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that is, to all true beleeuers, that not onely acknowledge, but embrace and practiſe Chriſt crucified in true mortification; they are dead to the Law, and to Sinne, and are freed from that bondage, and altogether vnder Grace, and vnder the New Teſtament.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16098:63"/>liue in theſe dayes as well as we: but to liue vnder, is to be ſubiect to it, and to liue vnder the power, and the Lawes of the New Teſtament: So much of this hold as we haue in the New Teſtament, ſo much hold we haue in God; little hold in this, and little hold in God; great hold in this, great hold in God; no hold in this, no hold in God. Ye ſee what the Teſtament is, Iuſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, therefore examine your ſelues concerning both: Firſt, for Iuſtification, what right haue you in Chriſt, for the forgiueneſſe of your ſinnes? Haue you Faith in his Blood? Are ye perſwaded that you are fully ſatisfied for, in the death of Chriſt? Or if ye haue not this full perſwaſion, what degrees or what meaſure haue you thereof? Except you haue the truth of this reſolution in your Hearts, you can challenge no part in this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Then for Sanctification, tell me, you that profeſſe the New Teſtament, how is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſinne and you? Hath ſinne dominion ouer you? Then you are not vnder Grace, but vnder the Law. Is the Spirit of God within you? Doe you find him to liue and moue in your inward parts? Is the Law of God written in your Hearts? for that you ſee is one expreſſe part of this Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: you haue it in your Eares, and in your Heads, and in your Mouthes, but that is nothing except you haue it in your Hearts; and what is it to haue the Law of God in your Hearts? It is to doe the will of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I haue deſired to doe thy will O my God, yea thy Law is within my Heart.</hi> Theſe things are our Legacie bequeathed in this Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16098:63"/>and therefore it ſtands vs vpon to know whether we haue receiued them or not. There be two ſpeciall markes whereby we may know our ſelues to bee truly vnder the New Teſtament: Softneſſe of Heart, and the aſſiſtance of the Spirit. Softneſſe of Heart, if we find our Hearts to be mollified, melting at the thought of our ſinnes, relenting at Gods Iudgements, compaſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the afflictions of Gods Children, plyable to Gods will, ouercome with the loue of Chriſt Ieſus in ſuffering for vs: this is a ſure ſigne that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpell is fulfilled vpon vs in ſome meaſure, which is, that he will take away our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Hearts, and giue vnto vs Hearts of Fleſh. Let euerie one of vs therefore lay our Hands vpon our Hearts, and ſearch, and anſwer as in the preſence of God, whether we find this ſoftneſſe in vs, or whether there be not as great hardneſſe of Heart in vs, as there was in the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſurely our vnableneſſe, and vnthankfulneſſe, and wilfulnes, which do generally reigne amongſt vs, doe teſtifie to the World that ſtill our Hearts doe continue in an obſtinate hardneſſe. Secondly, for the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, for the Promiſe of the Goſpell is the Promiſe of the Spirit, and it is proper to the ſtate of the Goſpell, that looke what the Word telles vs, and bids vs, or forbids vs, that doth the Spirit encline and perſwade our Hearts to beleeue and obey: doe our Hearts therefore tremble when the Word is preached? When we heare the Goſpell ſay, <hi>Belieue and thou ſhalt be ſaued?</hi> Doe vve find an ouer-ruling power in our Soules,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16098:64"/>rayſing vp our minds effectually, and cauſing vs to beleeue? Can we ſay truly, that when we heare the Word, we find the ſame Spirit working vpon our Hearts, Faith and Obedience, which hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired thoſe that teacheth vs? For this is the right ſtate of the Goſpell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.44. <hi>As ſoone as they heare, they ſhall obey me,</hi> as the verie ſame Spirit which ſpeakes vnto vs by the mouth of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſpeaking alſo and preuailing with our Hearts to true obedience: Let vs therefore labour, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for theſe two things, Softneſſe of Heart, and the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, that thereby we may ſee we haue our right and true entereſt in the New Teſtament.</p>

Conſider the happineſſe of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: Firſt, by the excellent titles of it: The former Teſtament is called the Law, this is the Goſpell, or glad tydings; that the Shadow, this the Subſtance; that the Couenant of Workes, this the Couenant of Grace or Faith; that the Letter, this the Spirit; that after the Fleſh, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Promiſe; that the Miniſter of Death and Condemnation, this the Miniſtration of Life:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16098:64"/>The Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.18, &amp;c. ſets forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of this eſtate, by comparing it with that of the Law, and amplyfies it, by that hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we are deliuered from, and the bleſſed condition that we are aduanced vnto, ſuch as if there be any ſence of Grace, or care of our owne good, it ſhould rayſe vs vp to much cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing. Secondly, ſee it by the longing and the deſire after it of others, many Kings and Prophets haue deſired to ſee the things that wee ſee, and heare the things that we heare, and haue not ſeene them, nor heard them. O what a bleſſed turne haue we therefore that enioy ſuch comfortable things, that ſuch great and holy Men deſired, and yet could not enioy them. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw theſe dayes, but it was afarre off, and yet he reioyced at it: We ſee them with our Eyes, and heare theſe things with our Eares, and ſee them with our Eyes they are not farre from vs, they are in our Mouths, and in our Hearts, how ſhould we reioyce in Gods rich mercie to vs, and in our rich Portion we haue in him? But you will ſay, had not they vnder the former Teſtament the ſame meanes of Saluation which we haue? Yes ſurely, the ſame in ſubſtance, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, yeſterday, and the ſame for euer.</hi> None were euer ſaued but by Faith in Chriſt Ieſus: But becauſe he was manifeſted to them, darkely, and ſparingly, and carnally, to vs cleerely, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and ſpiritually; therefore is our eſtate ſo much extoll'd aboue theirs. But is the onely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deliuerie ſufficient to make it a New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Yes, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.34. the Commandement
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16098:65"/>is called a new Commandement, though for the ſubſtance of it, it hath beene from the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet becauſe it is preſſed by our Sauiour after a new manner, that is to ſay, that we ſhould ſo loue one another, as he hath loued vs; therefore it is called a new Commandement. Thirdly, by the ſpeciall loue that Chriſt therein hath ſhewed vnto vs, that he ſhould remember vs poore wretched ſinners, in his will, long before we were borne, to beſtow a Legacie, ſuch a large and rich Legacie vpon vs, that the Lord Ieſus hanging vpon the Croſſe pouring out his owne Blood, ſuffering the verie pangs of Death, wraſtling with the verie wrath of God, and terrors of Hell, and aſſaulted with all the infernall Furies and Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhould euen then in the infiniteneſſe of his Diuine power and goodneſſe, entend to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for thee, and me, and euerie beleeuer, pleading for vs in particular by the power of his death, that we might haue our part in it, and in all the benefits thereof. Fourthly, by the certaintie of it, it is by Will, and therefore it is ſure and vnchangeable; not by the Will of Man, though that be a ſtong Conueyance, and cannot be altered, but by the Will of the Sonne of God himſelfe; who, or what can put vs by this Legacie, if once we be rightly inſtated into it? Neuer feare it, it ſhall neuer be taken from vs, Corruption and infirmitie may ſay vnto vs, that we are cut off, and the Diuell will face vs, that we haue no right of Grace, nor Heauen. Tell them that they are Lyers, Falſifiers of the Will and laſt Teſtament of Chriſt Ieſus. Fifthly,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16098:65"/>by the abſoluteneſſe and compleat perfection of Chriſts Will and Teſtament, there are all things concurring in it that are acceſſarie to the right na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Will: here is Firſt, the Teſtator, Chriſt Ieſus: Secondly, the Legators are the Faithfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirdly, the Legacies are Iuſtification, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Glorification: Fourthly, the Euidences, or Inſtruments, or the Will written, the Scriptures: Fifthly, the Seale, the Sacraments: Sixthly, the Witneſſes, the Prophets, and Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles: Seuenthly, the Executor, Gods Spirit, whoſe office it is to performe the beheſts of Chriſt Ieſus: If you aske for an Ouer-ſeer, it is God the Father, who by his almightie Prouidence doth eſpecially ouer-ſee theſe buſineſſes: The date of it was from the beginning of the World: the continuance of it is for euer: and therefore it is called the Blood of the euerlaſting Couenant, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.20. the Court where it is to be proued, is the Court of euerie beleeuers Conſcience here, and the Court of Heauen hereafter, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a moſt righteous Iudge, God himſelfe, euen the bleſſed Trinitie, who will ſurely ſee that euerie one of vs ſhall haue our Legacie which is bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vnto vs: a happy Teſtator, and happy Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Legacies, and therefore happy we who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer haue our portion in this happy Teſtament. Laſtly, by the ratification of it, which is, by his owne precious Blood, that which is more worth then all the World, that is the price thou art pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by, that is the Offering thou art conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by, that is the Merit thou art iuſtified by, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16098:66"/>is the Grace thou are ſanctified by, and that is the Power thou art ſaued by. What aſſurance may we haue of the free and full forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, when wee ſee they are all waſhed away by the Blood of Ieſus Chriſt? With what bouldneſſe may we come vnto the Throne of Grace, ſince we haue entrance vnto God thorough Chriſts Blood? With what courage may we fight againſt all our corruptions and rebellions within, againſt all the oppoſitions of the World without, againſt all the aſſaults and temptations of Satan both within vs, and without vs? We ſhall be ſure to ouer-come them all in the Blood of the Lambe. Let it be all our care to make our ſelues ſure, that we haue our part in this New Teſtament, thus ſealed with the precious Blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and then our caſe is moſt happy, neuer any thing ſhall ſeparate betwixt God and vs.</p>

            <head>THE SEVENTH LECTVRE VPON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORDS SVPPER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to our wonted manner we are now by occaſion that the next Sabboth day is a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion day, to fall into our digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againe touching the matter of the Lords Supper, that there may be ſome fit preparation of vs for that holy and heauenly dutie, ſomething to feed vpon all the weeke long, to quicken vs and to put vs in mind what we are to doe, and alſo to ſtirre vs vp that we may be fit and welcome Gueſts to come into the preſence of God. We haue entred as you ſee, vpon a fourth title that is giuen in Scripture to the Lords Supper, and that is, <hi>The New Teſtament,</hi> which howſoeuer it be ſet downe by <hi>Marke,</hi> by <hi>Luke,</hi> and by <hi>Paul</hi> yet becauſe <hi>Mathew</hi> ſets it downe more at large, as it is in <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. therefore we haue
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16098:67"/>made choyce of theſe words to treat vpon, <hi>For this is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> I will not ſtand to make repetition of that which I haue formerly ſpoken, becauſe of the ordinarie repetition that we haue euerie Sabboth of that which was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Sabboth before, and therefore to omit the expoſition of the Text which then we did largely inſiſt vpon, we are now to proceed to the matter of obſeruation. We began with one point, namely concerning the New Teſtament, ſhewing that all the hold that euer the Faithfull haue in Chriſt, is onely by the force, and power, and vertue of the New Teſtament: That was the firſt obſeruation. That being finiſhed we are now to proceed as God ſhall giue ſtrength and aſſiſtance to the other obſeruations that the Text will afford vs. We ſee that this Text doth mainly and directly concerne this buſineſſe that we haue in hand, and therefore it is needfull that we ſhould inſiſt ſo much the more vpon it. Yet I doe not meane to make any curious ſearch into euerie particular, for that would be too tedious: onely I will fixe and inſiſt (God willing) vpon ſuch ſpeciall and needfull points as are moſt naturall to the Text, and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall to our purpoſe. The ſecond thing, the ſpeciall and principall point that here is to be ſpoken vnto, is concerning the Blood of Chriſt: <hi>This is the Blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> The New Teſtament we ſpake of before, now we are to ſpeake of the Blood: <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament:</hi> Which may be taken as this Euangeliſt reports
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16098:67"/>the ſpeech of our Sauiour Chriſt: ſo in <hi>Marke</hi> 14.24. <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> Then the entendment is, that this Blood is proper and peculiar to this Teſtament. But if we take it as <hi>Luke</hi> reports it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. and as <hi>Paul</hi> reports it in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, &amp;c.</hi> then the entendment of it is this, namely, this Teſtament is ratified and confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt, as by the ſpeciall Scale thereof, and that the fruit, and power, and benefit of this ſame New Teſtament, doth wholly reſt vpon Chriſt his Blood: anſwerable therefore to this ground we will draw the Doctrine and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Take it thus, namely, that ſeeing our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith, that this is my Blood of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, obſerue this point.</p>

               </label> That all the power and efficacie of the New Teſtament, and of the worke of our Redemption by Chriſt, is founded, and grounded, and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vpon the Blood of Chriſt: <hi>This is the New Teſtament in my Blood.</hi> We will ſpeake firſt a word or two by explication to vnfold the knot, and ſo proceed to the proofe of it.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for explication, all the power and efficacie of the New Teſtament, and of the worke of our Redemption by Chriſt, is founded and eſtabliſhed vpon the Blood of Chriſt: You ſee here, I ioyne the New Teſtament and the worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption both together: The reaſon is, becauſe they are in effect one and the ſame: the verie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the New Teſtament, is the verie worke of our Redemption; and one and the ſame Perſon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16098:68"/>Chriſt, is the Mediator of them both: It is Chriſt that is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, and it is he that is the Mediator of the worke of our Redemption.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I ſay it is founded and ſtabliſhed in Chriſt: For this Teſtament is a Couenant, or a Promiſe: Now wee know that all the Promiſes of God are in Chriſt, <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. All Gods Promiſes, they are made in Chriſt, and are verified in Chriſt, and haue all their force in Chriſt: and ſo is this Promiſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly and laſtly, I ſay vpon the Blood of Chriſt, as Chriſt ſhedding his owne Blood for it; if ſo be it were the Blood of any, or of all the World beſides, it could doe no good, it could not make good this Couenant: But when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> here the New Teſtament is perfectly confirmed, and the worke of our Redemption is thoroughly accompliſhed. And ſo much for the explication of the point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the proofe of it, that all the power and efficacie of the New Teſtament, and the worke of our Redemption is founded and ſtabliſhed vpon the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. from Verſe 3 to the 12. there the Prophet ſets before vs Chriſt Ieſus as our Mediator, &amp; as our Redeemer: Hee ſpeakes more like an Euangeliſt then like a Prophet, he ſpeakes ſo plaine: But for the moſt part, all the deſcription that he makes concerning Chriſt, is concerning his humiliation, and ſo ſpeakes concerning the benefits that we haue by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16098:68"/>Chriſt, as comming to vs by his humiliation; he was deſpiſed &amp; reiected of Men, he was wounded, oppreſſed, afflicted, broken, and the like: and in <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. it is ſaid, <hi>With his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> the healing of vs commeth by the ſtripes of Chriſt Ieſus: all tending to the Blood of Chriſt: And in <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. we are giuen a portion of God to him, becauſe he hath not ſpared to poure out his Soule vnto the death. The Holy Ghoſt ſets forth Chriſt as a Mediator of the New Teſtament, and of our Redemption, and theſe things they concerne his Blood, and ſheweth the benefit that we haue by him, which is by his humiliation, by his ſtripes, <hi>and he ceaſed not to poure out his Soule to the Death.</hi> To ſpeake ſome-wnat more particularly of the point, becauſe it is a verie neceſſarie point to be ſpoken of: and though euerie one of vs can ſpeake of it, yet we haue not a true relliſh of it; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digeſt it; and therefore I would faine worke the true relliſh of it into your Hearts. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth propound our Sauiour vnto vs as the Mediatour of the New Teſtament, and of the worke of our Redemption in ſundry particular tearmes, and generally all of them tend to this effect, to ſhew that all the power, vertue, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the New Teſtament, and of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is founded and ſtabliſhed vpon the Blood of Chriſt, theſe ſixe particulars eſpecially. Firſt, Chriſt in his Suffering, or Chriſt puniſhed for vs. Secondly, Chriſt in his Offering, or Chriſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for vs. Thirdly, Chriſt in his Obedience, or Chriſt humbled for vs. Fourthly, Chriſt on
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16098:69"/>the Croſſe, or Chriſt crucified for vs. Fifthly, Chriſt and his Death, or Chriſt dying for vs. Sixthly, Chriſt and his Blood, or Chriſt killed and ſlaine for vs.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Chriſt in his Suffering, or Chriſt puniſhed for vs, which is not onely reſtrained to his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and afflictions in this life, as ſlanders, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, hunger, and the like; but to be extended to the maine and greateſt ſuffering of all, namely, to the loſſe of his Life, the ſhedding of his Blood, and the pouring out of his Soule, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.46, 47. Chriſt ſpeakes there ſo of himſelfe: <hi>Thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe againe: That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſsion of ſinnes might be preached in his Name.</hi> The ſuffering there ſpoken of is Chriſt his dying, as appeares by the oppoſition that Chriſt muſt ſuffer and riſe againe: there it is ſaid, that he muſt doe thus and thus, <hi>That repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes might be preached in his Name:</hi> giuing vs to vnderſtand, that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes, they are not purchaſed by Chriſt, nor haue no power from Chriſt, nor are not to be preached in his Name, but onely ſo, as they come from Chriſt ſuffering and being puniſhed for vs: <hi>Chriſt muſt firſt ſuffer, that repentance and remiſsion of ſinnes might be preached in his Name.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Chriſt muſt ſuffer and dye for ſinne, that he might bring vs to God: So it appeares in the laſt part of the Verſe, that he ſuffered and was put to death, faith the Text: And what was it for? Why it was for ſinne: <hi>For the taking away of ſinnes, and the bringing of vs to God:</hi> that is to ſay, the making
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16098:69"/>good of this new Couenant: that is to ſay, That God would be our God, and we his People; that he would forgiue vs our ſinnes, and remember our iniquities no more: theſe haue their power, vertue and efficacie from Chriſt, as he being puniſhed for vs. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.12. Our Sanctification there is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the ſuffering of Chriſt, that is to ſay, to the death of Chriſt: <hi>For Chriſt that he might ſanctifie the People with his owne Blood, hath ſuffered,</hi> or dyed <hi>without the Gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſt in his Offering, or Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for vs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Chriſt hath loued vs, and gaue himſelfe for vs, to be an Offering and a Sacrifice of a ſweet-ſmelling ſauour to God.</hi> He is a ſweet-ſmelling ſauour to God generally in reſpect of his ſacred Perſon, and he is a ſweet ſauour in reſpect of his bleſſed Nature, and in reſpect of his holy life, but more eſpecially, in reſpect of his pretious death, wherein he gaue himſelfe as a ſweet-ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſauour to God. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Chriſt was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take away ſinnes,</hi> inſinuating vnto vs, that Chriſt was powerfull for the taking away of ſins: How, as he was Chriſt offered, or as he was Chriſt ſacrificed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.10. So likewiſe our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is by the offering of Chriſt, Chriſt by that one offering of his hath ſanctified vs. So likewiſe in the twelfth Verſe, there is our Iuſtification, and in the fourteenth Verſe, there is our Conſecration by one Offering; and in the fifteenth and ſixteenth Verſes, there is the New Teſtament confirmed by name, by the verie offering of Chriſt. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle implyes the reaſon by the offering of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:16098:70"/>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Chriſt in his Obedience, or Chriſt humbled for vs: In <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. from the ſixth Verſe to the ninth, there you ſhall find that the worke of the New Teſtament, and of our Redemption is aſcribed to Chriſt his doing of the will of God: He tooke away the firſt, and eſtabliſhed the ſecond; he put away the Sacrifices of the Law, of burnt Offerings, and eſtabliſhed the New Teſtament: that is, by doing the will of God, by his obedience and humiliation: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>For as by one Mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many alſo be made righteous.</hi> It is the obedience of Chriſt that iuſtifies vs, and makes good vnto vs the Couenant of Grace: And that we may know, that it was not all the obedience of his life (which was moſt holy) that could ſerue the turne, the Apoſtle telles vs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>That he became obedient, euen to the Death of the Croſſe:</hi> The loweſt degree of his Humiliation, was the higheſt degree of his Obedience, and thereby he became a perfect Mediator.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Chriſt on the Croſſe, or Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for vs: And this intends more then the reſt. This intends not onely a bare dying of Chriſt, but a violent, a ſhamefull, and a curſed Death, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Chriſt hath made our peace by the Blood of his Croſſe;</hi> that is to ſay, by the ſuffering that he did endure, ſpecially vpon the Croſſe: Likewiſe in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.14, 15. He faſtned our ſinnes vpon the Croſſe, and there tryumphed ouer the Powers of Darkeneſſe (which is the verie matter of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption) And in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.31. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16098:70"/>
               <hi>is the Prince of the World caſt out:</hi> What ſpeakes he there of his Croſſe? <hi>And if I be lift vp, then will I draw others after me.</hi> Now are the Faithfull to be drawne vnto Chriſt, after that he had dyed vpon the Croſſe. It was Chriſt vpon the Croſſe that vanquiſhed the Diuell, Death, and Hell, and drew the Faithfull to him. And in <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.30. <hi>Now it is finiſhed,</hi> ſaith Chriſt when he was vpon the Croſſe, the laſt breath that Chriſt fetched. When all his humiliation was finiſhed, then the worke of our Redemption was fully accompliſhed. Hence it is that the ioy of the Faithfull is not ſo much in knowing Chriſt, as in knowing Chriſt crucified. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. I know no Man (ſaith the Apoſtle) after the Fleſh, no not Chriſt himſelfe: What not Chriſt himſelfe? No, not after the Fleſh, not as a Man, not as a holy Man, not as a <hi>Iew,</hi> not as one of my owne Blood, but Chriſt crucified. <hi>I eſteeme to know nothing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but Chriſt, and him crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. And indeed this is the verie ſubſtance of the Goſpell, Chriſt crucified. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. We preach vnto you (ſaith the Apoſtle) not ſimply Chriſt, but <hi>Chriſt crucified;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the eighteenth Verſe it is called, <hi>The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Croſſe,</hi> and ſuffering of Chriſt. All this ſhewes, that Chriſt in his Croſſe, and Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, he is the Perſon by whom the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the worke of our Redemption is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Then fifthly, The Death of Chriſt, or Chriſt dying for vs: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We are reconciled to God by the death of Chriſt.</hi> There you ſee our reconciliation
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16098:71"/>is aſcribed to the death of Chriſt: So alſo our Sanctification is aſcribed to the death of Chriſt, in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.22. likewiſe in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.14, 15. there it is ſaid, That Chriſt hath vanquiſhed the Diuell by Death, and hath deliuered vs from Death, and the bondage that we were in: All this was by the death of Chriſt, by Chriſt his dying for vs. So in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. it is ſaid, that Chriſt is the Mediator of the New Teſtament thorough Death.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Then the ſixth and the laſt point is the Blood of Chriſt, or Chriſt killed and ſlaine for vs. True, Chriſt layd down himſelfe willingly in obedience to God for vs vpon the Croſſe, and in loue to vs his People. He gaue himſelfe for vs, and he ſhed his owne Blood for vs: Yet in regard of the Act and the Inſtrument, he was no better then ſlaine, killed, and murdered, and his Blood and Life was taken from him verie wrongfully: But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding howſoeuer it be, his willingneſſe on the one ſide, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> crueltie on the other ſide, yet ſo it was, that his Blood was ſhed, and the ſhedding of his Blood is that whereupon the New Teſtament, and the worke of our Redemption is ſtabliſhed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. We are iuſtified by the Blood of Chriſt, there our Iuſtification is aſcribed to the Blood of Chriſt; ſo our Redemption is aſcribed to the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5.9. and in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. all runs vpon the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.5. <hi>We are waſhed from our ſinnes in his Blood,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth vs from all our ſinnes:</hi> The fetching of vs within the Couenant of Grace is by the Blood of Chriſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16098:71"/>
               <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. and ſo indeed is the whole worke of our Redemption aſcribed to the Blood of Chriſt. You ſee then how rich and plentifull the Scripture is in this Argument, all tending wholly to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to teach vs that the verie matter whereupon the New Teſtament, and the worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is founded and ſtabliſhed; is the Blood of the Lord Ieſus. I am bold to inſiſt ſo long vpon the proofe of this point, becauſe the Scripture is ſo plentifull in it. Wee will come now to the Reaſons.</p>

It is true indeed, that all the Couenants and Promiſes of God are firme and ſure in themſelues, becauſe God hath made them, and they need no Seale: yet becauſe God hauing made this Couenant reſpectiuely, that he would haue it ſealed and confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt Ieſus: Therefore looke whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer force and benefit it is of to vs, it is by vertue of the Blood of Chriſt: And hence it is that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer can ſhew this Seale for themſelues, that they haue part in this Blood of Chriſt, they may challenge that they haue their part in the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and whoſoeuer cannot, they haue no part in it.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16098:73"/>the matter of our reioycing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould reioyce but in the Croſſe of Chriſt.</hi> The Blood of Chriſt is the ground and verie founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Through Faith in his Blood, &amp;c.</hi> What is it that the Faith of a beleeuing Man doth moſt properly embrace, but the Blood of Chriſt?

It is a world of heauenly comforts that a ſpirituall minded Man may gather vnto himſelfe in the meditation and the beholding of the death of Chriſt, when we thinke of Chriſt crucified, and of Chriſt ſhedding his Blood, there you may ſee, Firſt, our ſinnes puniſhed to the full. Secondly, there we may ſee our ſinnes pardoned to the full. Thirdly, there we may ſee our ſinnes crucified, and mortified, and ſubdued by his Blood, and by the power of the death of Chriſt ſoundly applyed to our Soules and Conſidences, our ſinnes begin to dye, and to be mortified, and to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in vs. Fourthly, in Chriſt crucified we may behold the Fleſh crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. we may ſee our wicked humors to be mortified and to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were caried after the things of the world, after our luſts and corruptions; but when once we are truly partakers of Chriſt crucified, then we are crucified to the World, and the World to vs, and then we ſcorne the things of the World, the great riches, and high promotion, and the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt things we account them as Dung of the Earth. Againe, when we conſider Chriſt crucified, there we behold how patient we ſhould be in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, euen to the death; there is the picture of our whole life, which muſt be a continuall courſe of mortification; and there is the ſeaſoning of our death, looking thoroughly vpon Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it is that which ſeaſons our death, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer death commeth and ſeaſeth vpon vs, it ſhall be a ſweet paſſage to a better life.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y occaſion of the time that the next Lords Day wee purpoſe, God willing, to come to the Lords Table, wee are now to make digreſſion into the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper. I ſhewed you that one of the titles giuen to the Lords Supper, is the New Teſtament, as it is ſet downe by <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Mathew</hi> is moſt plentifull in ſetting downe the words of our Sauiour, we made choyce of his words to ſpeake of, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. <hi>For this is my Blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many, for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> And we propounded theſe three particulars to inſiſt vpon: The firſt whereof is this, that it is called here the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: and there we ſhewed, that all the hold we
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16098:77"/>haue in God, as many of vs as liue vnder the ſtate of the Goſpell, we hold it by force and vertue of a New Teſtament, as the old being aboliſhed. The next point was the Blood of Chriſt, the Seale whereby the Teſtament is confirmed. The third followes to be handled, and that is the benefit that followes of this Teſtament, and by the Blood of Chriſt, and that is remiſſion of ſinnes, for ſo it followes, <hi>Which is ſhed for many for the remiſsion of ſinnes,</hi> as that being the reach and end of both, both of the New Teſtament, and of the Blood of Chriſt. God is pure, holy, iuſt, and righteous: pure, and therefore free from ſinne; holy, and therefore hating ſinne; iuſt, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſinne; righteous, and therefore a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of ſinne: Man is full of ſinne, and therefore vncleane, and therefore hatefull to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore damnable and puniſhable by the rule of Gods Iuſtice, in ſo much that there is no hope nor poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie that euer any Couenant of Loue and Peace ſhould be eſtabliſhed betwixt God and Man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept firſt ſinne be remoued, and therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt interpoſing himſelfe a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man, to make ſuch a Couenant, muſt take ſuch a courſe, as whereby ſinne might be taken out of the way, and ſinne cannot be taken away, vnleſſe it be remitted on Gods part, and God will not, nor in Iuſtice cannot remit it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of Blood; for where there is no ſhedding of Blood, there is no remiſſion: Hence it is that Chriſt our Mediator comming to make this Couenant, ſheds his Blood for the remiſſion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16098:77"/>of our ſinnes: And this is the right ſtraine and meaning of theſe words, <hi>My Blood which is ſhed for many far the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> In handling theſe words, Firſt, we will conſider of the phraſe or manner of ſpeech here vſed, <hi>Remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> Secondly, we will remoue ſome exceptions or doubts. And thirdly, we will proceed to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. Firſt, touching the phraſe or matter of ſpeech, <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> that is, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: There are ſundry phraſes in Scripture, that ſignifie forgiueneſſe, to couer, to forget, not to impute, to blot out, to waſh away ſinne: but none either more vſual or ſignificant then this, to remit, that is, to let goe, or paſſe by, or to looſe ſinne: It doth moſt pithily vnfold both the nature of ſin, and of forgiueneſſe. Sinne hath a double reſpect, Firſt, to God himſelfe: Secondly, to his Law: I grant that there is but little difference in the thing it ſelfe, for that which is done againſt God, is done againſt his Law; and that which is done againſt Gods Law, is done againſt God himſelfe: But yet for Doctrine ſake we diſtinguiſh them ſo in our conſideration. Firſt, ſinne hath reſpect to God himſelfe: for if there were no Lawes made to forbid and puniſh miſdemenours done againſt the Kings perſon, yet if a Subiect do ought againſt him, he is an offendor, and iuſtly puniſhable, euen becauſe the one is a Subiect, and the other a King: ſo if God had made no Lawes at all againſt ſinne, yet if we do any thing againſt God, we are ſinners, and iuſtly lyable to Gods wrath and ſentence of his diſpleaſure, euen becauſe he is God: Sinne is a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16098:78"/>wrong to God, for he being our Creator, and we his workemanſhip, if we ſhould doe him his right, we ſhould giue him all our whole ſeruice; then when we ſinne, we faile of that, and ſo we wrong God. Now when God forgiues vs our ſinnes, he remits or puts vp our wrongs: ſo ſinne is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God, he being perfectly holy, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made vs holy too: By holineſſe we glorifie God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50.23. <hi>He that offereth prayſe, glorifieth me,</hi> By ſinne we diſhonour him, as being that which is vtterly vnbeſeeming both our ſelues and our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: when he forgiues ſinne, he remits and paſſeth by this diſhonour. Sinne is an opposition and enmitie againſt God, hee being goodneſſe it ſelfe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee onely haue I ſinned.</hi> When he forgiues ſinne, he remits or lets goe this enmitie, not laying it to heart, nor taking notice of it. Secondly, ſinne hath reſpect to Gods Law, whereto it alſo carries direct oppoſition, for ſinne is the tranſgreſſion of the Law. Gods Law is a binder, it layes a ſtrait chaine or bond of perfect obedience vpon euerie Man, whereby we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tied to do all that Gods Law commands, and to auoid all that it forbids: whenſoeuer we faile either in omitting the good, or committing the euill, we ſtand bound in the bonds of the Law not performed: when God forgiues vs our ſinnes, he remits theſe bonds for the time paſt, &amp; looſeth vs from them, for ſo the Apoſtle reſtraines it to the time paſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>To declare his righteouſneſſe by the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes that are paſſed.</hi> It layes a ſecond bond on vs by conſequence, and that it,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16098:78"/>that when we haue ſinned, we are in bondage to ſinne; <hi>He that commits ſinne, is the ſeruant of ſinne, Iohn</hi> 8.34. And how comes this to paſſe? Meerely by the rigour of the Law, puniſhing ſinne paſt, by a ſubiection to ſin afterward: when God forgiues vs our ſinnes, he remits and looſeth theſe bonds alſo. There is a third bond, and that is the heauieſt of all, the eternall curſe of God vpon transgress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, wrapping them in chaines of eternall darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and damnation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Curſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to doe them:</hi> When God forgiues vs our ſinnes, he remits and looſeth vs of theſe bonds too, in Chriſt he ſets vs free from them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed vs from the curſe of the Law, when he was made a curſe for vs.</hi> To ſhut vp this point, our ſinnes are vſually called our debts, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. and Gods forgiuing, is the remitting or releaſing of theſe debts: wherein the Lord (as he is rich in mercie) ſhewes himſelfe an exceeding mercifull Creditor, he remits not onely the forfeiture and penaltie, which is the curſe, but euen the whole bond, the principall debt of obedience it ſelfe, for the time paſt, for that which we did owe vnto God, and haue not payd him. Thus much light we haue receiued touching this ſweet and heauenly Doctrine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, by the occaſion and benefit of this phraſe, Remiſſion, that is, looſing our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A doubt or two is to be remoued touching the matter it ſelfe, <hi>Remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> Firſt, is this the onely benefit of Chriſt Blood ſhed? Is this the whole ſubſtance of the New
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16098:79"/>Teſtament? I anſwer no, it is not: the Teſtament containes two branches, Iuſtification and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: the remiſſion of ſinnes, and the renewing of the Heart: ſo the words are, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.31, &amp;c. which is die place where this Couenant is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally mentioned: and ſo Chriſts Blood is ſhed for the confirmation of both, but onely this named by a figuratiue ſpeech in other caſes of like nature, yea in this verie caſe in other places of Scripture, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 32.38, &amp;c. <hi>I will giue them one Heart, an done way, that they may feare me for euer, &amp;c.</hi> He ſpeakes that of our Sanctification, but vnder that branch is vnderſtood and meant the whole Couenant, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes too, though it be not expreſt. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27. which the Apoſtle quotes out of <hi>Eſay</hi> 27.9. there is mention made of the Couenant and he names but one branch of it without the other, Remiſſion of ſinnes, and not Sanctification, but both are to be vnderſtood, and being both but one Couenant, one may well ſtand for both; The New Teſtament, and Chriſt his Blood ſhed, is as well effectuall for the one as for the other. Secondly, here ſeemes to be ſome contradiction in the words; to ſhed Blood for ſinne entends ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and remiſſion of ſinne entends free pardon: How is that ſaid to be remitted, that is fully ſatisfied for? And how is that fully ſatisfied for, that is freely remitted? I anſwer, they are ſo farre from contradiction, that they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily goe together: For where there is no ſhedding of Blood, there is no remiſſion, which is as much to ſay, where there is no ſatisfaction, there is no
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16098:79"/>forgiueneſſe: God is exactly iuſt, and exactly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; and he cannot ſhew exact Iuſtice, but he muſt ſhew exact Mercie: Gods exact Iuſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that ſinnes be fully ſatisfied for; his exact Mercie requires that they be freely forgiuen: ſo in reſpect of Iuſtice they are fully ſatisfied for; but in reſpect of Mercie they are freely forgiuen. Againe, conſider Chriſt and our ſelues: in reſpect of Chriſt our ſinnes are not freely forgiuen, but ſatisfied for; in reſpect of vs they are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, but freely forgiuen: It is full ſatisfaction in him; but free forgiueneſſe to vs. Theſe points being cleered, let vs come in the third place to the Doctrine, and that is this: in that it is here ſaid, <hi>Blood ſhed for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerue, that the whole and entire benefit of all Chriſts doings and ſufferings for vs, is chiefely and indeed wholly and really conferred vpon vs in the remiſſion of our ſinnes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>By whom we haue redemption thorough his Blood, euen the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> By whom; who is that there ſpoken of? It is Ieſus Chriſt, of whom in the former Verſes the Apoſtle ſaith, That all the good we haue from God, is beſtowed vpon vs in him. And what hath he done for vs?

Firſt, It was ſo promiſed by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>I will alſo bleſſe them that bleſſe thee, and curſe them than curſe thee: and in thee ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> Here God makes a Couenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and it was this verie Couenant of Grace, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. where he calles it expreſly, <hi>The Goſpel,</hi> for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of the Law was not then in being till 430 yeeres after, as we may ſee in Verſe 17, and this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16098:88"/>Couenant was then effectually ſealed by the Blood of Chriſt, though not actually till Chriſt came in the Fleſh. What is the tenor of this Couenant? <hi>That in him all the Families of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed?</hi> All, farre or neere, ciuill or barbarous, <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Gentile.</hi> But that is ſpoken to <hi>Abraham,</hi> what is that to Chriſt? Yes, for it is not ſpoken of the perſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but of the Seed of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.18. <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> And who is that Seed? It is Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.25 expounds the Couenant ſo, and applyes it to the <hi>Iewes;</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3.8. 14.16. expounds the verie ſame Couenant ſo to, and applies it to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Now all the Nations of the Earth are either <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo that it is not reſtrained to one Nation, but inlarged gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the whole Many of the World. Secondly, It was ſo propheſied, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.5. <hi>And the Glorie of the Lord ſhall be reuealed, and all Fleſh ſhall ſee it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> What is the Glorie of the Lord? It is the Saluation of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.6. <hi>All Fleſh ſhall ſee the Saluation of God.</hi> And what is this Saluation of God? It is Chriſt Ieſus ſealing this Couenant with his owne Blood. Now when this Couenant is thus ſealed by the Blood of Chriſt, it ſhall not be a hidden Myſterie, as in former times, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to ſome few, but it ſhall be plainly reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the view of the World, <hi>All Fleſh ſhall ſee it;</hi> and that not as ſpectators only, or bare beholders, but they ſhall ſo ſee it, as that they ſhall partake in the benefit and power of it; for ſo it appeares in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16098:88"/>the firſt and ſecond Verſes of that Chapter, which is a Preface to this Verſe, <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my People, ſpeake comfortably to Ieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> they ſhall ſo ſee it, as that they ſhall receiue comfort, remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and reconciliation by it. Thirdly, It was ſo performed by our Sauiour, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. Our Sauiour himſelfe makes this extention, <hi>Come vnto me all ye that are wearie and heauy laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> All are inuited to come to him that find any need of him; and all that ſo come, let them be of what Nation, or faſhion ſoeuer, are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there part in him: So it was ſulfilled by our Sauiour. Fourthly, The Apoſtles alſo witneſſe this euerie-where, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to euerie one that beleeueth, to the Iew firſt and alſo to the Grecian.</hi> The Apoſtle makes both a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall extent of this benefit to all ſorts, <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Grecian,</hi> and withall ſhewes the ſpeciall qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch perſons as ſhall haue the benefit of it, <hi>Euerie one that beleeueth, Gal.</hi> 3.28. <hi>There is neither lew nor Gentile, there is neither bond nor free, male nor female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> He reckons vp not onely Nations, but States, and Sexes, and ſhewes that there is no difference in reſpect of the Couenant of Grace: There is a difference in Men by Nation, ſome are <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſome <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but there is none in the ſtate of Grace; there is ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Men in reſpect of Condition, ſome are bond, &amp; ſome are free; and ſo there is a difference in reſpect of Sexes, ſome Male, and ſome Female, but all are one in Chriſt; there is no difference at
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16098:89"/>all in Nation, Condition, or Sex, in reſpect of the Couenant of Grace, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. <hi>If any Man ſinne, we haue an Aduocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the Iuſt, and he is the reconciliation for our finnes, and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole World.</hi> Here the Apoſtle breakes out into more larger termes then all the reſt, the whole World, or Face of the Earth; that is of all Times, Places, degrees; alwayes prouided, that they be ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as the Apoſtle before ſhewed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.

It is true, that they being his owne Workemanſhip, he might of his owne abſolute will and power, caſt away any kind, yea all kinds, and ſorts of Men: For may not the Potter doe with the Clay what he will?

How is that? By our holineſſe of life, and vpright conuerſation; we ſhould ſhine as Lights vnto them, in all good workes, that by

And ſurely, if the liues of Chriſtians were ſuch as they might and ought to be, who knowes but that they might haue beene wonne long ere this? We trade and trafficke with them in many places, and they care not to deceiue vs, and we care as little to deceiue them: They take hold of this, and other ſuch great ſcandals, and that is one great cauſe of the continuance of their hardneſſe. God intends this our prouocation of them, by giuing vs the Goſpell: For this is that prouocation which the Apoſtle ſo much vrgeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. When the Father offers a peece of Bread to his Child, if the Child be ſullen, and refuſe it, the Father will offer it to a Dogge, and the Child ſeeing that, will catch at it, he will haue it himſelfe rather then the Dogge ſhall haue it.

Let vs therefore euerie one examine our ſelues, whether we haue this grace of Faith, or no: If we haue it, we may and muſt come to this Sacrament, to haue it further confirmed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs; yea, if our Faith be but weake, and that we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16098:94"/>haue but ſome beginnings of Faith, let vs not be afraid, if it be true, and from the Heart, God will accept it and vs; but if vpon due examination we find that we haue no true Faith, let vs not flatter our ſelues, and preſume to come in hope of any good thereby; it ſhall be ſo farre from doing vs any good, that it ſhall doe vs a great deale of har me; It ſhall be Iudgement to vs and condemnation.</p>

            <head>THE TENTH LECTVRE VPON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORDS SVPPER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now according to our wonted manner, to turne out of the Catechiſme, and to proceed in the argument of our preparation to the Lords Supper, the next Lords day being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion day, wherein we purpoſe, God willing, to meet together at the ſame. We left in <hi>Math,</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, that is ſhed for many, for the remiſsion of ſinnes;</hi> which place, as I ſhewed you, doth moſt copiouſly and plainly proue vnto vs this title, that belongs to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, namely, that it is called the New Teſtament; for that is the head we did reduce this place vnto: Wherein we haue ſhewed you, Firſt, concerning
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16098:96"/>the New Teſtament, the Matter and Subiect here ſpoken of. Secondly, we haue ſhewen concerning the Blood of the New Teſtament, whereby this the Teſtament is confirmed and ſealed: <hi>This is the Blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> Thirdly, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite both of this Teſtament, and of the Blood of Chriſt: <hi>Remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> Laſtly, the Perſons that are partakers of this benefit: <hi>That is many:</hi> The whole World of Beleeuers: <hi>This is the Blood of the New Teſtament, ſhed for many.</hi> So much then ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken of theſe words, as they are conſidered abſolutely in themſelues, ſo as they concerne the death of Chriſt. We are now further to conſider of them as they are reſpectiuely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and applyed to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, for you ſhall vnderſtand that our Sauiour here performed two buſineſſes in one: Firſt, he ſheweth the redemption of the beleeuing World, by his ſauing Death: <hi>This is my Blood, ſhed, &amp;c.</hi> This Blood of the New Teſtament, it is the onely procuring cauſe of remiſſion of ſinnes, and of the Saluation of you, and of all that are, or ſhall be ſaued: and to this effect tends all that hitherto hath beene ſpoken. The ſecond thing our Sauiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes here in this caſe, is the confirmation or applycation of this his ſauing Death, to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the reſt of the beleeuing World, in and by the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: <hi>This is the Blood of the New Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, This Sacrament which I now haue in hand, is a ſpeciall and excellent meanes whereby to apply this my ſauing Death to you, and to euerie belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16098:96"/>Receiuer: And thus, and in this ſence we are now to treat vpon it. <hi>This is the Blood, &amp;c.</hi> As it is ſpoken reſpectiuely by applycation to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper: Thus we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of it that it is vttered by our Sauiour, by a kind of maieſtie, and ſpeciall grace of ſpeech: <hi>This,</hi> theſe Elements, this Bread and Wine, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Action we now haue in hand: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it imports an inſtitution of a new Sacrament, and of a moſt excellent Sacrament: As if he ſhould ſay, All the Faithfull that euer haue liued from the beginning of the World, haue had ſome Sacrament or other, as the Cogniſance of their profeſſion, as the nouriſhment of their Faith, as outward teſtifications of the mutuall Couenant betwixt God and them: But <hi>this,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>is the Blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> This is a new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſuch as none of them euer had; this is a more liuely and ſenſible repreſentation of your reconciliation vnto God, then euer the Faithfull before you were made partakers of: <hi>This is the Blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> To make our Sauiour his meaning plaine and perfect to euerie Mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, we muſt ſupply two Rules that are here implied and preſumed vpon: The firſt is this, That euerie Couenant betwixt God and Man, muſt be confirmed by ſome outward ſigne and Sacrament. The ſecond, that there muſt be a due proportion, betwixt the Couenant that is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the Sacrament, that doth confirme the Couenant. The firſt Rule, euerie Couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man, muſt be ratified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16098:97"/>by ſome Sacrament and outward ſigne: God deales with vs herein in great wiſedome, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, meeting both with our Infidelitie, and with our Apoſtacie, our ſlipperineſſe to fall from him: with our Infidelitie, becauſe we hardly will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him, vnleſſe he bind himſelfe to vs, by ſome outward ſigne; with our ſlipperineſſe to fall from him, becauſe we eaſily ſtart and budge from him, except we be bound to him by ſome outward ſigne, as by a continual remembrancer, calling vpon vs to hold faſt our hope we haue in him, The ſecond Rule: There muſt be a due proportion betwixt the Couenant that is ſealed, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ratifies and ſeales it: Old and weake Couenants, and well enough if they be ſealed with old and weaker Sacraments : But ſaith our Sauiour, This is a New Teſtament, and then here muſt be a new Sacrament: An old Couenant, an old Sacrament: A new Couenant, a new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A new Sacrament, and a new Couenant agree: But a new Sacrament, and an old Couenant are miſ-matcht: they muſt be ſorted in their kind, our Sauiour giues the Rule, <hi>Marke</hi> 2.21, 22. which by application may be alleaged in the caſe: <hi>No Man puts new wine into an old Veſſell; &amp;c.</hi> Old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doe not agree with the New Teſtament, let them goe with the old: This New Teſtament, muſt haue new Sacraments. This Teſtament, ſaith our Sauiour, which I come to make, and to ſeale with my Blood, <hi>Is the New Teſtament,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is alſo anew Sacrament: The Teſtament being better then the former, the Sacrament muſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16098:97"/>therefore be better then the former: And here it is that he ſpeakes with ſuch a maieſtie, as if he ſhould ſay, This is ſuch as neuer any of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full had before my comming in the Fleſh. And ſo much for the fitting of this ſpeech of our Sauiours to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: For in the words there is no difference: Apply them to the Death of Chriſt, and then the caſe is plaine, <hi>This is my Blood, &amp;c.</hi> That is, My Blood of the New Teſtament is effectuall for the forgiueneſſe of ſins. Apply them to the Sacrament, and in a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſence, <hi>It is the very Blood of Chriſt, ſhed for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> We come to ſuch obſeruations as here ariſe for our inſtruction, when it is ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> ſpeaking of the Sacrament: hence obſerue, that</p>

               </label> The Sacrament of the Supper is proper to the ſtate of the New Teſtament onely: <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> Our Sauiour appropriates this Sacrament to this Teſtament onely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. It is called there by the name of the Lords Table, which very name proues the point in hand, the Lords Table, that is, the Table of the Lord Ieſus, not onely ſuch a Table, as where in Chriſt was the Food fed vpon, for ſo he was in ſome ſort in the Sacraments of the former Teſtament, but ſuch as wherein the Lord Ieſus himſelfe was bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſent in his Fleſh, ſuch as he himſelfe with his bodily preſence did ſpeed, ordaine, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for a memoriall of thoſe things he had done and ſuffered alreadie, for the worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption as a Mediator, and therefore may well
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16098:98"/>be called the Table of the New Teſtament, as <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. Chriſt already come, Chriſt bodily preſent amongſt vs, this belongs to the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.7, <hi>&amp;c. Loe I come, In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Booke it is written of me, &amp;c. He taketh away the firſt, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond.</hi> The bodily comming of our Sauiour in the Fleſh was the eſtabliſhment of the New Teſtament, Chriſt being bodily preſent in the Fleſh at this Table in the Fleſh, becauſe his Fleſh was that onely which he was bodily preſent in, and the Table being ſpread for a memoriall that he was come, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Fleſh, is therefore proper onely to the New Teſtament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. It is there called <hi>The Lords Supper.</hi> Why is it ſo called, but becauſe it was inſtituted at the laſt Supper which the Lord in the dayes of his Fleſh made, and which he did appoint as a witneſſe of his Will and Teſtament for euer? Now what is the ſtate of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but the ſtate of ſauing Grace, which the Lord Ieſus hath brought vnto vs from Heauen, when he came amongſt vs, liued amongſt vs, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt vs, and ſupped amongſt vs? But that ſtate of ſauing Grace which he preached and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with with his owne Mouth, in the time of his Life? But that ſtate of ſauing Grace which he ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and confirmed with his owne Blood at his Death? But that ſtate of ſauing Grace which he as it were in the twy-light betwixt the day of his Life, and the houre of his Death did ratifie and confirme by this Sacrament of the Supper? This ſtate of ſauing Grace, is the New Teſtament, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16098:98"/>therefore the Lords Supper is the Sacrament of the New Teſtament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of Bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> Here you ſee the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is the Communion of the Body &amp; Blood of Chriſt. In the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament, his Blood was ſhadowed: In the New Teſtament, it is really communicated. In the Sacraments of the former Teſtament, Chriſt was in ſome meaſure really communicated in his Body &amp; Blood to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but darkely, weakely and ſparingly: But here he is communicated vnto them clearely, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and bountifully. In a word, Chriſt his Body and Blood was communicated to the Faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former Teſtament, in the Sacrament to be broken, to be ſhed: But here in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Body as being already broken, and his Blood as already ſhed: This belongs to the New Teſtament, and therefore this is the Sacrament of the New Teſtament. In <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> ſpeaking of this Sacrament. Now remembrance is properly of the things that are paſt: Chriſt hath ordained this as a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his doings already paſt, the matter of our Saluation, as of a matter already fulfilled. This is the voyce of the Goſpell of the New Teſtament, Chriſt is already come: as the voyce of the Law was, Chriſt is to come. That I ſay is the voyce of the New Teſtament: And therefore the Sacrament of the Supper, is a Sacrament of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16098:99"/>the New Teſtament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>As oft as you eat of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup; you ſhew forth the Lords Death till he come.</hi> He ſaith not, you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew, that was for the Sacraments of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but you doe ſhew, that is, you declare, publiſh, and expreſſe the Death of Chriſt: You celebrate, ſhew forth, and ſenſibly act his Death, the thing before acted vpon the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the point are theſe: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Firſt Chriſt himſelfe is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.5. and 12.24. that is, Chriſt is the maker good of the Couenant of Grace betwixt God and Man (for to be the mediator of the Teſtament, is to make good a Teſtament) Chriſt did this by his Blood, by his Interceſſion and Redemption; there is the Office of our Sauiour, here is his taske, here is the buſineſſe he is to be imployed in: He was not careleſſe in going about his owne buſineſſe; He was not a medler in other Mens matters; He would not make Lawes for others, but for his owne; He would not ſet his Seale to another Mans Teſtament, but to his owne: This Teſtament is his, he made it good, he ratified it with his owne Blood: The Sacrament was his, becauſe he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted it, this being preſumed vpon, that he would not meddle with other Mens matters, make Lawes for others, or ſet his Seale to other Mens Bonds, and ſo forth. The Sacrament being ordained by him to be a Seale thereof, is therefore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the New Teſtament.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16098:99"/>The Couenant of ſauing Grace, and that is, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>I will put my Lawes into their Hearts, and in their Minds will I write them: Their ſinnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities will I remember no more.</hi> The word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this Sacrament is annexed, is the Couenant of Grace; ſuch as the word is, ſuch is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But the word is the New Teſtament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt be of the New Teſtament onely.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, The whole Couenant of Grace, is the miniſtration of the New Teſtament onely, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>God hath made vs able Miniſters of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi> Such as the miniſtration is, ſuch muſt be the holy things they adminiſter: The miniſtration is of the New Teſtament, therefore the holy things adminiſtred, the Word and Sacraments are of the New Teſtament.<hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonns were Miniſters of the holy things of the Law: Chriſt and his Apoſtles are Miniſters of the Goſpell, and of the Couenant of Grace. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes muſt not meddle with the Sacraments of the Goſpell: Chriſt and his Apoſtles muſt not meddle with the Sacraments and Sacrifices of the Old Teſtament. They muſt keepe themſelues to their owne: Such as the miniſtration is, ſuch are the things adminiſtred. Our whole miniſtration is of the New Teſtament, and therefore the holy things adminiſtred, as the Sacraments, are proper to the New Teſtament onely.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16098:100"/>of the New Teſtament, they are proper to that, and therfore the Sacraments, where by it is ſigned, ſealed, and repreſented, and ſet forth vnto vs, muſt be of the New Teſtament: For the Blood is Chriſts: <hi>This is my Blood, &amp;c.</hi> The Teſtament is Chriſts, he made it good: The Sacrament is Chriſts, he ordained and inſtituted it, and he doth in this ſpeech, annex it to his Blood inſeparably, and withall to the Teſtament inſeparably, and ſo conſequently, he annexes the Sacrament inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the New Teſtament: And ſurely when our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> he ſpeakes it as in a proper ſence of the Blood in his Body: ſo in a Sacramentall ſence, of his Blood in the Sacrament, he giues vs to vnderſtand, that the Sacrament in a ſacramentall ſence is, the Blood of the New Teſtament, as the Blood of Chriſt in a proper ſence is the Blood of his owne Body.</p>
            <p>The Vſes of the Point follow:</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, It commends vnto vs the excellencie of the New Teſtament aboue the Old: What a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mercie of God is it for vs, that are reſpited to liue in thoſe dayes wherein the Lord hath vouchſafed vnto as all other things, ſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New Teſtament, fit for the Couenant of Grace, which we profeſſe and imbrace; he hath beene pleaſed to giue vnto vs, Chriſt himſelfe in a more fuller manner, then to the old People in the former Teſtament, in the time of the Law. To them in Promiſe, in Sacrifice, in Saddowes: To vs in Subſtance. To them a farre off: To vs neere, he came amongſt vs, he ſuffered, was conuerſant,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16098:100"/>and dwelt amongſt vs. Beſides this, he taught them the Doctrine of Saluation, but it was ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in Myſteries, in a kind of darke Cloud: But we ſee it in ſo cleare a Glaſſe, that euerie Man that runs may read it. Yet farther, God hath giuen vs Chriſt more fully, the Word and Doctrine of Saluation more fully, and the Sacraments of the New Teſtament more liuely, ſenceably, teachable, ſpirituall, and heauenly, then the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament, where they are more liuely repreſentations of Chriſt, and more palpable and pregnant figures, of the fruit and benefit purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his ſufferings: when they vnder the former Teſtament were to ſpell Chriſt in the eating of the Paſchall Lambe, it was a hard matter for them ſo to doe: But when, we come to doe this, in this Sacrament, in the breaking of the Bread, and pouring forth of the Wine, where the words of Inſtitution are added thereunto, as alſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saluation, concerning the Death of Chriſt, if we cannot now ſpell him, our blindneſſe is horrible. This is that glorious Miniſterie the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law was glorious, but the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit is more glorious: This is in an other maner, he giues two reaſons for it: The one, It is the miniſtration of righteouſneſſe: The other, the miniſtration of the Spirit. The miniſtration of the Law, by reaſon of Mans corruption, was Death: The miniſtration of the Goſpell, is Life: Here is matter of Righteouſneſſe, the free mercie of God in Chriſt. That was of the Letter, this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16098:101"/>of the Spirit. Looke what was deliuered to them in the Word and Sacraments, it was done out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, there was not that neere acquaintance of the Word and Spirit as now is. It is common to the Goſpell to be generally attended by the Spirit of Grace, and there it is the miniſterie of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. When we are to preach the Word, and to adminiſter the Sacraments, the Spirit attends vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Ordinances, to ſanctifie to the Heart and Conſcience of the Beleeuer, thoſe things are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vnto him.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> The ſecond Vſe teacheth vs, that the more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully God deales with vs, the greater meanes he affords vs, the greater our ſinne, and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the more vnexcuſable are we, if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſame. Haue we greater light then they had? Let vs then walke according to that light: He lookes for that he giues to euerie Man: where he giues much, he lookes for much: where he giues a better light to walke by, he looks that we ſhould walke by a better light: and therefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath vouchſafed this vnto vs, he requires that our liues and conuerſations ſhould be more holy and religious, then thoſe that liued in a more obſcure light, vnder the times of the former Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Eſpecially, we muſt not contemne and neglect theſe things: He that deſpiſed the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> dyed without mercie: And what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of vs, if we trample the Blood of the New Teſtament vnder our Feet? If we neglect ſo great Saluation? If thoſe that contemned the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Old Teſtament, were in a damnable
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16098:101"/>caſe, In what a fearefull condition are we, if we defile the Blood of this New Teſtament? which we ſhall doe, if we come not with prepared Hearts, with reſolution to ſerue God, to breake off our ſinnes, to be rayſed vp in conſideration of God Promiſe in Chriſt, and with a full purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination for hereafter to become new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore as we would not bring Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vpon vs, ſo let vs be carefull, that we are not omiſſiue herein.</p>

And likewiſe for your ſelues, it teacheth you carefully to lay vp thoſe heauenly things, in good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Hearts, that Gods purpoſe and your faith may meet together, and ſo redound to your euerlaſting comfort and Saluation.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> The fourth and laſt Vſe of the Point is this, Here is matter of reproofe againſt many bad, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and graceleſſe Receiuers. Firſt, of thoſe that are ignorant of the matter of Saluation; this is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, and that is a ſtate of life and knowledge; they that are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of this, the Sacrament is not them, nor ſuch perſons muſt not come vnto it. In the ſecond place, it reproues ſuperſtitious Receiuers, that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16098:102"/>come as the Papiſts, and thinke that for the deed done they ſhall be iuſtified, and find good will, as if the action of it ſelfe were of effect, that it workes Grace, whether they haue Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or no. The Sacrament of the Supper, is the Sacrament of the New Teſtament: The ſtate of the New Teſtament, requires God to be worſhipped in Spirit and Truth, not formally, but in Faith and Repentance. Thirdly, it reproues thoſe that come to it vncharitably, ſuch muſt not come till they haue diſpenſed with their high ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, and are reconciled to their Brethren. This Sacrament is the Sacrament of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: The New Teſtament is a Couenant of Peace, not onely betwixt God and Man, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Man and Man: Not onely glorie vnto God on high, but peace vpon Earth, good will towards Men: And ſuch as come vncharitably, they are Vſurpers, they meddle with that they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe withall. Fourthly, it reproues thoſe that are vnregenerate, they conceit with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that howſoeuer they vnderſtand not the matter of Saluation, though they haue no perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods loue, yet that the Sacrament may worke this. No, they are deceiued, the Sacrament makes vs not good, but confirmes vs in the ſtate of Righteounſneſſe, in that good which God hath already wrought in vs. The Word and Spirit makes vs new Creatures, the Sacraments ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs already made. This Sacrament is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the New Teſtament, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch as haue part in that Couenant of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16098:102"/>Grace: Such as are vnregenerate, haue no intereſt in the Couenant, and therefore no part in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe. Laſtly, it reproues Phariſaicall and Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarie Receiuers, that ſtand vpon their owne Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: This is a Sacrament of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, the New Teſtament is the Couenant of Grace, free pardon, and remiſſion of ſins, through the Blood of Chriſt: Whoſoeuer then ſtand vpon their owne Righteouſneſſe, and thinke to be ſaued by the leaſt meaſure, part, or contribution of their owne workes or merits, haue no part in the New Teſtament, and ſo haue nothing to doe with this Sacrament: This is onely for ſuch as haue their ſhare in the Teſtament, that apply and caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon God: Here I am a wretched and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinner, I haue nothing to ſay for my ſelfe, I haue deſerued thy wrath, I caſt my ſelfe vpon thy promiſes, for the free remiſſion of my ſinnes, in the Blood of the Lord Ieſus, there is my plea. Thus come and welcome: But otherwiſe, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> thou haſt no part in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So much for the firſt point, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper is proper to the ſtate of the New Teſtament.</p>

            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:16098:103"/>
            <p>We ſhall not need to ſeeke farre for proofe, but onely to the words of inſtitution, here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where vſed: That which is in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood which is ſhed for you,</hi> ſome read it, and ſo the originall of the Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, becauſe of the Particle <hi>that:</hi> That it is ſpoken in reference: to that in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People; I will forgiue their iniquitie, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ſinner no more.</hi> This is the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now adminiſtred: He ſaith, not a part of it, but that whole Teſtament which the Lord there promiſed by the Prophet, is conferred vnto vs in this Sacrament: So looke how farre the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extends that God made, ſo farre this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extends it ſelfe. The Teſtament extends to the matter of our Iuſtification, that he will forgiue our iniquitie: And to the matter of our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that he will put his Law into our Hearts: and therefore the Sacrament being an effectuall pledge of that whole Teſtament, doth as well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelfe to the matter of our Iuſtification, as to the matter of our Sanctification, in both which conſiſts the Couenant of Grace. And that which our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> proues as much. He ſaith, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my continuance, and workes of this and that act, but of all that euer I haue done and ſuffered for the accompliſhment of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in remembrance of whole Chriſt, as a Man would ſay. And whereas it is here ſaid, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16098:103"/>likewiſe by the other Euangeliſts, <hi>For Remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> This proues the point by the nature of the phraſe, and likewiſe by the matter it ſelfe: By the nature of the phraſe, Remiſſion of ſinne, is but one part of the Couenant, part being put for the whole, as I ſhewed you in the opening of the Text: But much more by the matter, for the truth is this, That God neuer remits any Mans ſinne, but he regenerates him: And therefore, if it be effectuall for the one, it is alſo effectuall for the other: If for our Iuſtification, then alſo for our Sanctification. Laſt of all, when it is ſaid by our Sauiour, in <hi>Mather, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> That it is the Teſtament in his Blood, it ſhewes that it is a pledge of the whole Couenant of Grace: For the Blood of Chriſt is the cauſe of our Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo of our Sanctification: The cauſe of our Iuſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. The cauſe of our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. That <hi>according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification of the Spirit vnto obedience, and ſprinkling of the Blood of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The Blood is effectuall both to our Iuſtification and Sanctification: The Sacrament in a Sacramentall ſence, is the Blood of Chriſt, and therefore in a Sacramentall ſence is effectuall, as well to our Iuſtification, as to our Sanctification: It is an effectuall Seale of the whole worke and Couenant of Grace.</p>

Secondly, we muſt hunger and thirſt after them, we muſt deſire to receiue aſſurance, that our ſinnes are pardoned; increaſe of Grace, and Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And laſtly, we muſt labour, and we muſt ſtirre vp our ſelues, and pray vnto God, that we may profit by it, that we may receiue the whole Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, thus freely tendered vnto vs: If we conſider the ſignes, they are in the ſingular wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, fitted to our capacities, to performe this dutie: There is Bread and Wine, both of them fit either for comfort or ſtrength: Wine ſpecially for comfort; Bread for ſtrength, as the Scripture ſpeakes of them: What better comfort then the forgiueneſſe of ſinne, when the Soule receiueth aſſurance that ſinne is pardoned? The Wine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo comfort the Heart naturally: But the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16098:106"/>of Gods loue in Chriſt, that ſin is forgiuen, doth comfort our Hearts ſpiritually a great deale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: How ſweet is matter of Iuſtification? As Wine refreſheth the Heart, ſo the aſſurance of the pardon of ſinne, comforts the Soule. Here is alſo Bread, which ſtrengthens the Heart; what greater ſtrength is there then that, when the Heart is ſtrengthened by Grace, when we are ſetled in a ſtedfaſt purpoſe to lead a godly life, when he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth vs with his free Spirit? The Bread doth not ſo much ſtrengthen our naturall life, as the bleſſing we receiue in this Sacrament, the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace of God, our ſpirituall life in the wayes of godlineſſe. Theſe things we muſt raiſe vp our minds vnto; we muſt not thinke that theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are idle ſignes, but powerfull to ſeale many excellent things vnto vs, if we haue Hearts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne ſuch excellencies as the Lord therein hath treaſured vp for vs. Let vs diſcerne in theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, matter of our Iuſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, matters of excellent comfort and ſtrength, the true comforts and ſtrength of God, againſt our ſinnes, and againſt the temptations of Sathan.

So then we muſt conſider with our ſelues theſe things, we muſt be rayſed vp, and prepare our ſelues to be

            <p>The Perſons here ſpoken of (as you ſee) are ſet forth in generall tearmes, <hi>Many:</hi> But <hi>Luke</hi> in his two and twentieth Chapter, and the twentieth Verſe, reports this ſaying of our Sauiour, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken with particular reference and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Diſciples, the Perſons onely then preſent at this buſineſſe: <hi>This is the New Teſtament in my Blood, ſhed for you: Mathew</hi> ſaith, <hi>for many: Luke, for you:</hi> Both one and the ſame ſpeech of our Saviour, and if wee vnderſtand them both aright, and expound the one of them by the other, we ſhall find a ſweet concurring and agreement betwixt the Euangeliſts themſelues, and likewiſe much profitable matter, by this their ioynt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The Sacrament it ſelfe, in reſpect of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vſe of it, is a publike Ordinance, that is common to many: The whole Church of God, and all the Faithfull from time to time, are to take the benefit, and to make vſe of it to the end of the World: and that is one part of <hi>Mathew</hi>'s meaning here, when he ſaith, <hi>for many.</hi> But the particular adminiſtration of this Sacrament, at that time when it was firſt inſtituted, was peculiar to the Diſciples onely, as they onely then receiuing it; and that is ſome part of <hi>Luke</hi>'s meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>for you.</hi> But yet further alſo, whereſoeuer this Sacrament ſhall be thus in vſe, and thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, it muſt be done in an Aſſembly: Many muſt be preſent at it: And that is the other part
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16098:110"/>of <hi>Mathew</hi>'s meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>for many.</hi> On the other ſide, thoſe Perſons to whom it ſhall be thus adminiſtred, muſt receiue it with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar apply cation: It muſt be <hi>for you:</hi> And likewiſe by conſequent, they muſt be ſuch Perſons, ſo qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in ſome meaſure, as the Diſcipies were: that is to ſay, They muſt be Beleeuers, that it may be truly ſaid of them, as of the Diſciples, It is <hi>for you:</hi> And this is the other part of <hi>Luke</hi>'s meaning, <hi>for you.</hi> Take it thus: The Sacrament of it ſelfe in generall, <hi>is for many,</hi> the whole Church of God muſt make vſe of it: The particular adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it at that time, was for the Diſciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they onely were the Receiuers: But yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereſoeuer it ſhall bee ſo adminiſtred, in particular Congregations, there muſt be <hi>many</hi> at it, <hi>many</hi> muſt communicate in it, and likewiſe thoſe <hi>many</hi> that communicate in it, muſt be ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with particular applycation, It muſt be <hi>for you:</hi> They muſt be Beleeuers, qualified as thoſe Diſciples, that it may be truly ſaid of them, as of the Diſciples, This is <hi>for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſtraine of our Sauiours ſpeech, and this is the according of both the Euangeliſts in ſubſtance agreeing together; and theſe bee the points, God willing, we will now inſiſt vpon.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing we are to conſider, is this, It is <hi>for many.</hi> I ſhewed you, one part of <hi>Mathew</hi>'s meaning, was this, namely, That the Sacrament it ſelfe, is a generall and publike Ordinance for the whole Church to make vſe of it.</p>

The Wine that we poure out, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt?</hi> You ſee there, the Lords Supper is called by the name of Communion, the Communion, that is to ſay, principally of the Faithfull with Chriſt their Head, but reſpectiuely it is intended of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which they haue amongſt themſelues: Now this is ſealed vp vnto vs in this Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as well as the other, as the Apoſtle proceeds to ſhew in the ſeuenteenth verſe, where he applyes it to this Communion of the Faithfull among themſelues: <hi>We that are many, are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16098:111"/>one Bread, and one Body, becauſe we all are partakers of one Bread.</hi> The Bread is one, that is Chriſt: The partakers are many, all the Faithfull from time to time; but more ſpecially, thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate at the ſame time in the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that whenſoeuer this Bread is ſet before vs, there muſt be many preſent to partake of it: The words of our Sauiour, in the firſt inſtitution of it, inforce it, where bee ſaith: <hi>Drinke ye all of this:</hi> The Rule is perpetuall, not onely for that Communion then celebrated, but for all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: <hi>Drinke ye all of it:</hi> How can all be ſaid to drinke, if not many there, if not an Aſſembly at it? In the two and twentieth of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the ſeuenteenth Verſe, the Text ſaith, <hi>He tooke the Cup, and gaue thankes, and ſaid, Take this, and diuide it among you:</hi> Now how ſhould the Diſciples diuide it among themſelues, how ſhould the Faithfull al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo diuide it amongſt themſelues in the particular vſe of it, vnleſſe there be a competent Aſſembly amongſt them, that one may diuide it to another? Likewiſe the Rule of the Apoſtle, for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Abuſes in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, confirmes this Point. In the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> many abuſes were crept in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one amongſt the reſt was this, That they came together to eat, but yet ſome did diſorder themſelues by eating and drinking before hand, before the Congregation was all come in: The Apoſtle reproues and reformes this abuſe and corruption amongſt them, and wiſheth them
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16098:112"/>in the three and thirtieth Verſe, That when they were come together, they ſhould tarrie one for another. Why ſo? That there might be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent and full Aſſembly to communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe holy Myſteries of God: And this the Apoſtle grounds vpon our Sauiours inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as appeares in the three and twentieth Verſe, thereby confirming that which we alleaged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, namely, that our Sauiour meant ſo in the inſtitution of this Sacrament, that ſtill when there was any particular vſe of it, that many ſhould be met together to communicate in it. The practiſe of the Faithfull, that likewiſe giues teſtimonie to this Truth: For thoſe verie <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though they had much corrupted themſelues in the matter of the Sacrament, yet notwithſtanding, they ſtill held this as a ſure principle, that whenſoeuer they were to celebrate the Lords Supper, they were to meet together, as appeareth in the twentieth Verſe: I ſay, howſoeuer when they were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they carried themſelues not ſo orderly as they ſhould, and ought to haue done, yet they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued this as a ſure Rule, that there ſhould be an Aſſembly before they communicated in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper. In the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the two and fourtieth Verſe, it is ſaid, That the Beleeuers continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and breaking of Bread, and Prayers: Where by breaking of Bread, wee are to vnderſtand, the particular vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, as we ſhall ſhew more
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16098:112"/>at large hereafter. Now when the Text ſaith, They continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and breaking of Bread: Thereby is manifeſtly declared vnto vs thus much: That the Beleeuers did vſually meet together by whole Aſſemblyes at the partaking of the Sacrament of the Supper, as well as at the Preaching of the Word, Prayers, and other holy duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fellowſhip and ſocietie: They continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, Fellowſhip, breaking of Bread, &amp;c. This example wee haue in hand, is the moſt pregnants proofe of all. In the firſt Supper that euer was adminiſtred, who were preſent? All the Diſciples: For they were the charge that our Sauiour then had vnder his hands: The Text ſaith in the twentieth Verſe, He ſat him downe with the Twelue, hee had no more, otherwiſe they ſhould haue beene there: He ſat downe with the Twelue, therefore they were preſent: If <hi>Iudas</hi> did ſlinke away betwixt the eating of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, and the eating of the Lords Supper, yet the proofes holds true, that many were preſent, at the leaſt eleuen of them, and ſo it is manifeſt out of the firſt practiſe of the Diſciples, when it was firſt inſtituted, as alſo of the Church of God from time to time, in the Primitiue Ages, and ſo both by the Rule of our Sauiour, as alſo of the Apoſtles it appeares, that this Sacrament is for many, that is to ſay, that whenſoeuer it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, many are to be preſent, to communicate in it.</p>

            <p>The Vſes of the Point are theſe:</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> The firſt is matter of reproofe, and that of two ſorts of Tranſgreſſors againſt this Rule: The firſt is, of a notorious abuſe of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in the Popiſh Church, concerning priuate Communions, or Maſſes, as they call them: There priuate Communion is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to be priuate, becauſe it is performed in a Houſe, or ſecret place, for many times they doe performe it in the Church publikely; neither
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16098:114"/>priuate becauſe there are but a few preſent, for many times it is performed, when there are many People preſent as beholders; but a priuate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is, where the Prieſt that is to deliuer it to the People, eats and drinkes alone, and none eats and drinkes with him, as vſually it is in all places, where the Church of Rome rules: A horrible prophanation of the Lords Supper, and a flat vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of the practiſe of our Sauiour, and a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt contradiction to the nature of a Communion, for how can it be ſo tearmed, when there be no Communicants? How doe the Faithfull here communicate one with another? If there be any extraordinarie worthineſſe in their Perſons, then indeed the beholders may fare the better; or if there be any extraordinarie worthineſſe in their Actions; but their Perſons or Actions be no more worthy then our Sauiours. He gaue it to his Diſciples, and bad euerie one of them eat it for themſelues, and therefore you ſee a plaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the firſt inſtitution of that Ordinance, and an abuſe of the Sacrament hereby. But they returne vpon vs, why, haue not you your priuate Communions in <hi>England,</hi> and in other Reformed Churches? I anſwer, we haue priuate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſo haue others; but that is verie ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and neuer but when vrgent occaſion requires; but beſides, where we haue any, it is not as theirs is; the Miniſter neuer communicates alone; as theirs doe, but hath alwayes ſome to communicate with him: In caſe we goe to communicate with
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16098:115"/>the ſicke, our State inioynes, that there muſt be many of vs, and therefore not priuate in their ſence, as they vnderſtand it: So that ſtill, whether priuate or publike, there muſt ſtill be an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that is, ſo many as conueniently may be had. Concerning that matter of priuate Communion, as I haue obſerued, the carriage of it hath beene this, that the ſicke Man might receive it, if any were weake, and could no wayes come to it, and yet had a deſire to receiue, and were fit for it, the Ancient haue not ſtucke to communicate with them, in the priuate Houſe, but it was moſt warily obſerued: For this was their vſuall cuſtome, when the Communion was adminiſtred in the Houſe of God in publike, then, and at the ſame time, the Miniſter went, and carried the Communion, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately to the partie abſent, and ſo it was but one and the ſame Communion; and there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but the partie ſicke, being a Member of the ſame Congregation, in Gods acceptance, is a Communicate of the ſame, though abſent, and ſo both publike and priuate, is but one and the ſame Communion: Thus the priuate Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the publike, for it is not the difference of the place that breakes off the Communion the ſicke haue with of the reſt of the Congregation, if they deſire and thirſt after it: But this I thought good to ſpeake of becauſe the Point leads me to it, and it is prouided by our State, that there muſt be many.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of People to be reproued are
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16098:115"/>thoſe, that cauſeleſſely abſent themſelues from it, they leaue the roomes vnſupplyed, and forſake the Lords Table vpon Communion daies: I deny not, but ſometimes Men may haue cauſe to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but let euerie Man examine himſelfe well, let him debate the matter well, whether he hath a good, iuſt, and ſufficient cauſe, or no; for if he haue not ſuch a cauſe as God approues of, his ſin is exceeding great in abſenting himſelſe. Some abſent themſelues for the World, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One ſaid he had bought a Farme, another a Yoke of Oxen, &amp;c. Sinfull Man, ſhall the World hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee from God? Shall the buſineſſe of this life, hinder thee from the matters of thy Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Put the caſe thou getteſt the whole World, by being at home, and loſeſt thine owne Soule by being abſent from the Lords Table, O then what ſhall it profit thee to get the whole World, and to loſe thine owne Soule? Others cannot come, becauſe of their ſinne, that is to ſay, becauſe they haue not repented, they are not thoroughly prepared, they are not in charitie with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they deſpaire, &amp;c. It is true, here is a iuſt cauſe that they muſt not come, but this is no good cauſe that therefore they may not come: A good cauſe is that which God ſo approues of in mercie, that though Men be abſent, yet he accepts of them as if they were preſent, as in other duties, when he is pleaſed to diſpenſe with them, becauſe they haue ſuch a neceſſarie hindrance, and ſo imputes it not as ſinne vnto them. If there be matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16098:116"/>to with-hold vs, that is a good cauſe, we may abſent our ſelues without ſinne; but if a Man be out of charitie, and therefore comes not, here the cauſe is as bad, and as they not comming, it is a iuſt cauſe that he muſt not come, but not that he may not come. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Heart was not vpright in the matter of the guifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore this was a hindring cauſe, that he might haue no hand in it, but yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted him not from ſinne in that caſe, becauſe the ground was not good. If we be out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and therefore come not, this is a iuſt cauſe why we muſt abſent our ſelues, but yet this doth not free vs from the imputation of ſinne, becauſe our cauſe is not good: It is our owne fault that we cannot come, and ſo it doubles our ſinne.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Another Vſe of the Point is matter of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It ſhould ſtir vs vp to hearken to the voyce of God when he calles vs, we muſt imbrace the ſauing Ordinances of God, we muſt accept of his gracious offer be there tendreth vnto vs. Euerie Man muſt labour to make vp a full Aſſembly, to fill vp the roome God hath prouided at his Table, to come our ſelues, to bring our Wiues, Children and Seruants, ſo farre forth as they are capable of it, that they and we may prayſe the Lord, honour his Name, in the vſe of his ſauing Ordinances (as the Prophet ſaith) in the great Congregation. Our Sauiour inuites vs, he calles vs to come; if it were nothing elſe but a louing call, we ſhould iuſtly be blamed, if we were negligent herein; but this his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16098:116"/>inuitation is a charge to come, and therefore we ſinne if we come not.

Haue you Faith? Are you Beleeuers? Doth the Spirit of God witneſſe ſo much within
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16098:120"/>you? Doe you find the fruits of Faith in holineſſe of life &amp; conuerſation? Then come and welcome. If otherwiſe you find not this, more or leſſe, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly you haue no part nor portion in this buſines. Many ſcorne to be examined, ſpecially the elder ſort, they are loath to haue their infirmities, their weakeneſſe, inſufficiencie, and ignorance to be knowne. Proud Hearts, they had rather goe to Hell, then to haue their infirmities diſcouered. But all in particular muſt examine themſelues: and becauſe they that are not of the Miniſterie cannot ſo ſearch themſelues as we can, therefore they muſt come vnto vs, and if we vpon tryall ſay vnto them, Now you are fit, then they may come with cheerefulneſſe; Gods Meſſenger vpon the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had with them, hath bid them come, and therefore they may come with much more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and certainly ſhall find much more profit. But what meaſure of Faith is required, will ſome ſay? Surely this I will ſpeake; no meaſure of Faith that Man can attaine, will ſerue in Gods Iuſtice, but any meaſure ſhall ſerue in the acceptance of Gods Mercie; If true Faith, though neuer ſo little and weake, be of good cheere, it ſhall ſaue thee; Let it proceed from a good cauſe, and yeeld good fruit within thee, and then as I ſaid, though weake and ſmall, yet it is accepted of God in Chriſt. It was the caſe of theſe Diſciples at the ſame time: Were they Men of great Faith? No, of ſmall Faith: for the moſt part were ignorant, at the leaſt, doubting of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, without
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16098:120"/>which all Faith is in vaine, at the leaſt, they were not ſo thoroughly perſwaded as they ought to be, and yet well welcome, in thoſe beginnings and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of Chriſtian Faith: He adminiſtred the Sacrament vnto them. And therefore let vs looke our Faith be true, and let vs deſire and groane after more, and then though it be mixed with many doubtings and failings, yet the Lord will accept it, and in mercie will couer our infirmities in the obedience of Chriſt, and ſo we ſhall find the fruit of ſauing Faith in the vſe of this Sacrament: He ſhall make it good vnto vs for all ſauing purpoſes.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are now to divert and turne aſide into the Argument of the Lords Supper, ſpecially againſt this ſeaſon of the yeare above all other, wherin not only thoſe which are ſincere in Religion, but even thoſe that are counterfeit in Religion, pretend a kinde of conſcience to come to receive the Lords Supper: The fiſt head that we redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all thoſe things which wee purpoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound concerning the doctrine of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, were the names and titles that are given to it, wee have ſhewed foure of them, namely, the Lords Table, the Lords Supper, the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the New Teſtament: now we are to proceed to a fifth name or title that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is ſtiled withall; that is, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall or remembrance of Chriſts death: though the Sacrament be not expreſſely and in ſo many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16098:122"/>termes ſo called in any one place of Scripture; yet it is very neceſſarily and directly gathered both from the words of our Saviour himſelfe, as alſo from the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> from the words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> but much more plainly out of the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>You ſhew forth the Lords death till he come:</hi> the eating of this bread and the drinking of this cup is the ſhewing or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the Lords death till hee come: And theſe are the words that wee purpoſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note> God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to inſiſt upon for our proceeding in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, you ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> You know that names are juſtly given unto things, according to the nature of the things named: what is the nature of this Sacrament? the Apoſtle ſhewes here, that to eate this bread and to drinke this cup, is to ſhew forth the death of Chriſt by way of remembrance till hee come: therefore this is a fit and proper name to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the memoriall or remembrance of Chriſts death. Now becauſe as you ſee this Text ſpends it ſelfe wholly in this very argument, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will take it whole before us: and firſt we will ſhew the conſiſtance of the body of the Text in it ſelfe: Secondly, the meaning of the words; and thirdly, the parts of the Text, and ſo proceed to the doctrines.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſiſtance of the whole body of the Text ſtandeth thus: Theſe Corinthians to whom the Apoſtle writes this Epiſtle, were newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16098:122"/>to the faith of Chriſt by <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſtery, and they made profeſſion of this their faith by the uſe of Gods ſaving ordinances, particularly by the uſe of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: Satan according to his wonted malice when he ſaw hee could not utterly deprive them, nor keepe them from the uſe of this notable meanes of grace, hee labours cunningly to infect and ſtaine it, with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry corruptions, thereby to defile them in the uſe of this Sacrament, and ſo to make it unprofitable to them: and ſurely in a ſhort time hee prevailed greatly on their weakneſſe herein, and brought in much diſorder and abuſe amongſt them; yea ſuch groſſe abuſes, that they poyſoned their holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, verſe 17. they came together not for profit, but for hurt, whereas this Sacrament was ordained for their profit and good, by this means it turned to their hurt; ſuch groſſe abuſes they were as brought downe Gods ſenſible Iudgments upon them, verſe 30. <hi>for this cauſe many are weake and ſicke amongst you, and many ſleepe:</hi> ſuch as in a manner nullified the Sacrament to them, verſ. 20. this is not to eate the Lords Supper, you doe ſo corrupt and ſtaine it, that in effect you doe not eate it: one ſpeciall corruption amongſt them was this, verſe 21. that they taryed not one for another, that ſo they might communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but did prevent one another, they came to the Lords Table as to a ſcambling Feaſt, firſt come, firſt ſerved, a horrible abuſe in the holy and religious feaſt of the Lords Supper. The Apoſtle ſo ſoone as he heard of theſe abuſes, in zeale for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16098:123"/>Gods glory, in conſcience of his owne duty, and in a holy jealouſie for the pure uſe of the Lords Ordinances, and in a fatherly care which hee had over theſe Corinthians, whom he had lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to the faith, preſently takes a courſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and redreſſe theſe abuſes: and as the nature of all right and true reformations doth require, that when things are out of ſquare, they are to be refined and renewed, according to the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall: ſo the Apoſtle being to redreſſe the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Lords Supper amongſt them, he brings them backe to the firſt inſtitution, to the firſt Lords Supper that ever was, and by that patterne frames his reformation: and there he rehearſeth the inſtitution, verſe 23. <hi>This bread is my body, &amp;c. and this cup is my blood, &amp;c.</hi> there is the repetition of the inſtitution: the application for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is in the 26. verſe, <hi>For as often as you eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup, you ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> The ſumme of all, ſo farre as it concernes our preſent purpoſe is briefly this; as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid to theſe Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; O you Corinthians, you are much to blame that you ſuffer your ſelves to be ſo ſtained with ſo many corruptions in the Lords Supper, by name this is one, that you tarie not one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to communicate together, but one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents another, the rich eate before the poore come, as if we had more care of our bellies, than of Gods Religion and Chriſts ſufferings, this is a groſſe abuſe, it was not ſo in the beginning: In the firſt ſupper that Chriſt inſtituted, then all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16098:123"/>Diſciples were preſent, and did lovingly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate together, and therefore if ever you looke to celebrate the Lords Supper with comfort and benefit to your owne ſoules, you muſt doe as they did, reforme this errour, and tarie one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Conſider more particularly what a ſpeciall Item the Lord Ieſus gave them then, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> verſe 23, 24. whereby hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes all that come to the Lords ſupper, that their hearts and mindes be taken up, and wholly ſet upon the conſideration of the death of the Lord Ieſus, and all their paſſages in and about the Sacrament muſt ſhew forth and carie a relliſh of it; you muſt not minde your meat and drink, and hunger and thirſt, as this abuſe proves you doe; No, no, your mindes muſt bee wholly bent on Chriſts death, and ſurely if you be ſpiritually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and minde that ſoundly as you ought, you will have little minde of your bellies, but you will minde the body and blood of Chriſt, and ſhew forth his death till hee come, therefore reforme your ſelves, and purge out this corruption: This is the conſiſtance and dependance of the Text.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is the meaning of the words themſelves, <hi>For as often as you ſhall eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup, you ſhew the Lords death till he come:</hi> There is no great difficulty in the words, yet for plaineſſe ſake wee will goe over them with ſome familiar and eaſie expoſition: whereby alſo we ſhal make way to our obſervations. Theſe words in the 26 verſe are <hi>Pauls</hi> owne words, and not Chriſts; the words before verſe 26. and 25.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16098:124"/>are Chriſts owne words, but theſe are <hi>Pauls;</hi> in the former verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> as Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaking it: but here it is ſaid, <hi>You ſhew the Lords death,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking this concerning Chriſt: neither is this any wrong to our Saviour, that <hi>Pauls</hi> words ſhould be ſorted and joyned with his; becauſe they both procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ſame Spirit, which was in Chriſt, as alſo in <hi>Paul,</hi> though not in the ſame meaſure; yet in ſuch a meaſure even in <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, as that he was infallibly guided and freed from errour thereby in all his writings that are extant among us: <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech is here added to Chriſts ſpeech, not as any new or diverſe thing, but firſt, to confirme it, and give teſtimony to the truth of it; ſecondly, to expound it, and make it plaine for their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; thirdly, to apply it to them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to all the faithfull, as being ſo meant by our Saviour himſelfe, and not to his Diſciples onely, and ſo he performes the office of a faithfull Miniſter of Ieſus Chriſt, which is to confirme his words as a witneſſe, to expound them as an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, and to apply it to them as a meſſenger ſent to them for that purpoſe. It is ſaid here in the firſt place, <hi>as often as you eate,</hi> which containes an intimation, that they did often communicate, and withall an admonition that it is a neceſſary duty to communicate often; it is ſpoken of here as a matter commendable in them, and therefore imitable in us: for he would never have enjoyned a ſecond duty upon it, but that hee did approve the firſt: They muſt not thinke it enough that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16098:124"/>they have done it once, and that ſhall ſerve for all, nor to ſay they will doe it hereafter, though they omit it now, but as often as they doe the one they muſt doe the other; as often as they doe receive, they muſt thinke upon the Lords death. But ſome will ſay, What are we never to remember Chriſts death, but then when we communicate? Yes, this is not ſpoken by negation, as if we ſhould never remember him but then; but by affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we muſt ſpecially remember it then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other times, as that Sacrament being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ſanctified ſpecially for that purpoſe: next it is ſaid, <hi>So oft as yee ſhall eate, &amp;c. ye ſhall ſhew;</hi> where you ſee the Holy Ghoſt preſſeth it upon every one for his owne particular, ſhewing thereby that it is not enough that the Miniſter ſhew forth the Lords death for all them that bee there preſent, but every one is to ſhew it forth for himſelfe: Further it is ſaid, <hi>Shall eate this bread, &amp;c.</hi> you ſee here hee ſpeakes of the Sacrament, and he deſcribes it by the uſe or the actuall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of it; thereby ſhewing, that the benefit of this Sacrament doth not conſiſt in the ſeeing, or the having of it, but in the uſe and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in it. And note here further, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it bread even after the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; it is bread ſtill, and yet it is the body of Chriſt; in regard of the uſe it is altered, and is the body of Chriſt, but in regard of the nature of the creature it is bread ſtill. Conſider yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he nameth not onely the eating of the bread, but the drinking of the cup together with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16098:125"/>it; he ſaith not, Or drinke this cup, but, <hi>And drinke this cup:</hi> whereby we may ſee that they who ſeparate the cup from the bread in the uſe of this Sacrament, as the Papiſts doe, they doe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put aſunder that which God hath joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and this being ſpoken directly to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doth extend the words of our Saviour, when he ſaid, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> as well to the people as to the Miniſters: next it is ſaid, <hi>You ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> that is to ſay, you ſet it forth after a ſpeciall and eminent manner; you ſhew it forth by your practice, for all they that truly receive the Lords Supper, doe as it were act the death of Chriſt, as a holy Tragedy, upon a holy and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtage; the word may either be expounded affirmatively, you doe ſhew forth, or imparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as enjoyning them that they muſt ſhew forth; both tend to the ſame effect, that this Sacrament is the very ſhewing forth of the Lords death: the word in the originall entends a ſhewing forth in the higheſt degree, with much ſeriouſneſſe and earneſtneſſe, as preſcribing a zealous and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſetting forth of Chriſts death in the uſe of this Sacrament. It is ſaid further, <hi>the Lords death,</hi> which we muſt not underſtand as if it were meant barely of his dying, or of his crucifying, but his death, together with the benefit and fruit of his death: and whereas hee calls it here the Lords death, it may ſeeme ſome contradiction: For if Chriſt ſuffer death, how ſhould he be Lord, or if Chriſt be Lord, how ſhould he dye? but if wee conſider it well, we ſhall finde that it is a ſweet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16098:125"/>medley that the Apoſtle here makes, when hee ſaith it is the Lords death: Chriſt dyed as being man, but Chriſt even in his death ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee the Lord that had the power over death. And becauſe he that dyed was the Lord, thence it comes that his death is beneficiall unto us. As it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. God hath purchaſed his Church with his owne blood: as his blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore effectuall for the purchaſing of the Church, becauſe it was the blood of him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man is God alſo. Laſtly, it is here ſaid, <hi>till he come,</hi> that is to ſay, in bodily preſence to judge the world: Therefore he is now abſent in body even from the Sacrament: if he were bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Sacrament, as the Papiſts ſay, then what need a memoriall of him till his comming? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſee alſo that ſo long as we are here we need the helpes of Sacraments to ſtrengthen our faith, and God hath provided that we ſhall have them ſo long as we need them, even till the end of the world; but when he comes then we ſhall have no further uſe of them; and therefore then they ſhall ceaſe: all things are for us and for our good, ſo long as we need them we ſhall have them; but the things that are the Sacraments, Gods ſaving ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſhall utterly ceaſe to bee, when wee ſhall have no further uſe of them. So much for the meaning.</p>
            <p>The third point is the parts of the Text: firſt, an action to be performed, in the former part of the verſe: ſecondly, a caution or condition, in the latter part: Firſt, an action to be performed, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16098:126"/>receiving of the Lords Supper; wherein the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle offers to our conſideration theſe things: Firſt, the parts of the action; ſecondly, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of the action; the parts, eate and drinke; things diverſe in themſelves, yet both together making up one and the ſame action of receiving; as in our ordinary ſuppers wee eate and drinke, and each differs from other, our eating is not our drinking, nor our drinking is not our eating: yet in the generall both make but one action, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our ſupper: Secondly, the frequenting of this action, often, as this action is to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and done, ſo the doing of it is to be frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>as often, &amp;c.</hi> we muſt not make an annuall thing of it, to be performed once a yeare, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane thing amongſt Chriſtians, but there muſt be an often frequenting of it. In the latter part of the verſe is a caution or condition that we muſt performe in receiving, wherein principally is to be obſerved, firſt, the caution it ſelfe; ſhew forth the death of Chriſt: ſecondly, the frequenting of it, which is to be borrowed from the firſt part of the verſe, <hi>as often as you eate, ſhew forth the Lords death, &amp;c.</hi> for this is a particle common to the whole verſe, and ſerue each part alike, as who ſhould ſay, As often as you eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ſo often you ſhall ſhew forth the Lords death. Laſtly, here is the continuance of this caution or condition, <hi>till he come.</hi> How long is it to continue? even ſo long as the world ſtands, till the Lord come to judgement. Whoſoever thou art, thou muſt ſhew forth the Lords death
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16098:126"/>in receiving this Sacrament till his comming, that is for the parts of the verſe.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the Doctrines: <hi>For as often as you ſhall eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup, you ſhew forth the Lords death till he come:</hi> Where you ſee that this ſpeech of <hi>Paul</hi> is inferred by way of reaſon, from the words of our Saviour, verſe 25. <hi>Doe this as often as: do it in remembrance of mee:</hi> the conferrence of both theſe ſpeeches together miniſters this profitable obſervation; namely, that the true and right remembrance of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour IESVS CHRIST is our affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and religious remembrance of the death of our Saviour Chriſt: <hi>Remember me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, verſe 25. that is, ſaith <hi>Paul, the Lords death,</hi> verſe 26. Remember it ſo, that you ſhew it forth, that is, religiouſly and affectionately. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>I will poure upon the houſe of David, and upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Ieruſalem, the ſpirit of grace, &amp;c.</hi> there is a promiſe of the Spirit to be poured downe on the faithfull under the Goſpell; and one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall effection of it there mentioned is this, that they ſhall looke on Chriſt, that is, they ſhall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, and meditate upon him. Well, what is the principall object in Chriſt, that they ſhall ſet their meditations upon? his piercing, that is, his death and ſufferings, when he was pierced with thornes, and nailes, and Speare: and how ſhall they be touched with this remembrance of him? Surely very religiouſly and affectionately, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and lamenting as for their firſt borne. Here then is the right remembrance of Chriſt, that is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16098:127"/>our affectionate and religious remembrance of the piercing and death of Chriſt: <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Chriſt Ieſus is the Lambe of God that takes away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> But how doe the faithfull whoſe names are written in the Lambes booke of life apprehend him? Not ſimply as a Lambe, but as a Lambe ſlaine, that is, in his death and crucifying, that is the true and right apprehending of him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſeed of the woman, &amp;c.</hi> when the Lord himſelfe firſt publiſhed the Goſpell, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the ſeed of the woman to be beleeved in, that is, CHRIST, but with ſpeciall reference to his death, for that is the very bruiſing of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head: CHRIST on his Croſſe ſpoiled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. and the bruiſing of his heele there ſpoken of, is an intimation of the death and ſufferings that the Devill and his Inſtruments ſhould bring upon CHRIST; and yet theſe very ſufferings of Chriſt ſhall break and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all their power: this was <hi>Adam</hi> and all the faithfull to beleeve of Chriſt, and this is their true and right remembrance of Chriſt. This was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in the ſacrifices before the Law, as in the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6, 7. they ſhould kill it, and ſtrike the blood on the two poſts, &amp;c. what is the meaning of this? wee muſt carry the ſtreames of our meditations on Chriſt towards his killing and death and blood: And ſo under the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. almoſt all things are by the Law purged with blood: What is the meaning of this? That all that beleeve in Chritſt, are thereby admoniſhed ſtill to have the eye of their mindes ſetled on the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16098:127"/>of the blood of Chriſt; if ever they looke to bee purged from their ſinnes by Chriſt, they muſt bee purged by the blood of Chriſt: ſo the Prophets ſet forth Chriſt in this manner, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. from the firſt to the ſeventh verſe, hee that of all the Prophets ſpake moſt plainly of him, ſets him forth principally in regard of his death, as he was wounded, and broken, and oppreſſed, and affic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the Prophet leaves them the beſt memoriall of Chriſt, and therefore he acquaints them with the death of Chriſt. The Apoſtles obſerved the ſame rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 17.3. Firſt of all I delivered unto you how that Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes, no doubt but hee would teach them Chriſt ſo as hee might worke a moſt affectionate impreſſion and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt in their hearts; and how doth he this? By teaching them Chriſts death firſt of all, as the chiefe and maine ground of all the reſt. And looke how he taught them, ſo hee practiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I eſteemed not to know any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, ſave Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified:</hi> for his knowledge he eſteemed to know nothing elſe; and ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. for his rejoycing, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing but in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and both theſe are ſpoken by way of excluſion, diſclaiming all other knowledge and rejoycing in compariſon of that, becauſe that is the riſe and ground of all the reſt. To conclude, the Word and the Sacraments are purpoſely fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to worke this remembrance in us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. the word is called the preaching of the Croſſe, that is it the Miniſter muſt ſpecially preach, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16098:128"/>the people learne. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. the Apoſtle taught Chriſt and his death to them ſo plainly, as if hee had beene crucified amongſt them; and ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are fitted to this end, firſt, Baptiſme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. we are baptiſed into his death, and buried with him in baptiſme, and ſo the Lords Supper as you ſee here is to ſet forth the Lords death, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The reaſons: Firſt, Chriſt in his death was moſt pleaſing to God; and wherein ſhould wee, or can wee bee better affected with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt, than in that ſtate wherein hee was moſt pleaſing to his and our heavenly Father; God cannot properly be ſaid to be pleaſed with his Sonne at any one time more than another, but we ſpeake it after the manner of men, and by way of ſuppoſall, if ever God could be better pleaſed with him at one time than at another, it was at his death, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. then he was an offering and a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to God. I but you will ſay, then God was moſt angry with him, pouring on him his fierce wrath and vengeance from heaven? True, he was moſt angry with him in regard of our ſinnes which he beheld on him, and puniſhed in him, but in regard of his owne decree thereby accompliſhed, and Chriſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience therein yeelded; and the abſolute ſatisfaction for our ſinnes there made by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, even then God was beſt pleaſed with him, we feele it through Gods mercy, for we are ſure it was his death and blood that we are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by, and that God was pleaſed with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16098:128"/>us for, and therefore Chriſt himſelfe muſt needs be moſt pleaſing to him in that eſtate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, therein Chriſt ſhewed his greateſt love and affection to us, and how ſhall we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him with our beſt affections, but in that ſtate wherein hee ſhewed moſt love and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us? <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.13. Greater love than this can no man ſhew, than to give his life for his friend: this love Chriſt hath ſhewed us, he gave his whole ſtate for us; he ſpared not his precious body, his precious blood, his precious life, his precious ſoule for us, all theſe are precious, yea infinitely preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themſelves; yet hee thought nothing too precious to give for us, but expoſed them all in his death to the wrath of God for our redemption; whoſoever thou art that canſt thus remember Chriſt, thou haſt many ſtrong bonds and motives to binde thee faſt to thankfulneſſe, and love, and obedience to God in Ieſus Chriſt, and that is to remember him as thou ſhouldeſt remember him, he that can once ſpeake by experience in his owne heart, as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. that Chriſt hath loved mee, and gave himſelfe for me, will empty himſelfe alſo, and ſay as the Apoſtle did, <hi>I live, and yet not I now, but Chriſt Ieſus lives within me;</hi> his love to us in dying for us, ſtirres up our love to him in dying with him, and as the nature of true love is, to tranſanimate or transforme the lover into the thing loved, ſo we are turned as it were into Chriſt, we live not, but he lives in us; and ſurely we can never be perſwaded to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our ſelves thorowly to God ſervice, till wee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16098:129"/>be brought unto it by the thorow meditation and remembrance of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, therein Chriſt hath beene moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to us, and wherein is he moſt worthy of our remembrance, but in that whereby we have moſt benefit by him, and that is his blood or his death? <hi>We have reconciliation by his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by his blood, Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes by his blood,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. all good things temporall and eternall are purchaſed to us by the merit of his death, and contrary all evill things are thereby turned away: Why doe wee remember Chriſt? Not becauſe of any good that he receives from us, but becauſe of the good that we receive from him; now his death is that whereby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive greateſt good from him, yea in ſome ſort all the benefit that ever we enjoy by him, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, are ſo farre forth beneficiall unto us, as they have reference to his Death, and therefore except we remember Chriſt in his death, howſoever we remember him otherwiſe, it is no true remembrance of him at all.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, therein he ſhewed himſelfe moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull and victorious over his and our enemies: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He hath deſtroyed through death him that had the power over death,</hi> that is, the Devill. 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>He hath nailed our ſinnes upon the Croſſe,</hi> and there hath ſpoiled principalities and powers, how can we remember him better, than in ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gave the utter overthrow and deadly ſtroke to all our enemies? he told them that it was then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16098:129"/>their very houre and power of darkneſſe, and it is true to doe what they could, but not what they would, for that was but as it were a mocke to them, for indeed it was their very houre to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and his very houre to triumph over them, as our Saviour himſelfe ſpeaking of his death, ſhewes plainly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.31. <hi>Now is the judgement of this world; now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt out:</hi> If there were a Champion that ſhould undertake a combat for us, and overcome our enemies, wee would not conſider ſo much other circumſtances of his perſon or ſtate, but ſpecially his cariage and behaviour in managing our combat, and his act of overcomming. Chriſt our Champion hath overcome all our enemies in his death upon the Croſſe, and therefore that is the fitteſt object for our hearts to be ſet upon in the remembrance of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Vſes: The firſt uſe ſerves for reproofe of thoſe that are ſo nice and dainty, that they cannot endure to meditate on Chriſts death; the matter of his reſurrection, and aſcenſion, and glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are pleaſing unto them, but the matter of his death that is harſh and diſtaſtfull: all of us could be content to goe with Chriſt to Mount Tabor where he was transfigured, that we might ſee his glory; but we are loth to goe with him to mount Calvery where hee was crucified, to taſte of his ſufferings: the Iewes bewrayed this humour in the corrupt nature of man, when they ſaid, <hi>Let him come downe from the Croſſe, and we will beleeve in him:</hi> If Chriſt could be ſeparated from his croſſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16098:130"/>and ſufferings, and from his death generally all would be forward enough to take hold upon; but let us know, that except we have our part in Chriſt crucified, we ſhall never have our part in Chriſt glorified; the croſſe of Chriſt was his way to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and our due meditation and participation on his Croſſe, is the onely way for us to come to the participation of his glory. But ſome will ſay, to thinke upon Chriſt crucified, and ſlaine, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and tormented, theſe be bloody thoughts, how ſhould we digeſt them? I anſwer; Firſt, it is needfull for us that we ſhould bee poſſeſſed with ſuch bloody thoughts, that thereby we may bee brought to ſee and take notice of the uglineſſe and fearfulneſſe of our ſinne: but ſecondly, wee doe not dwell in the groſſe and carnall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wounds and blood-ſhedding, as the Papiſts doe; but we are ſpiritually minded in the meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his death and therein we behold <hi>Gods</hi> decree, in giving his Son for our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; his wrath againſt ſinne, and his mercy to us in the forgiveneſſe of our ſins, and this is it that makes our meditations and thoughts of Chriſts death to be moſt comfortable and heavenly thoughts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this teacheth us that wee ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bee skilfull and well practiſed in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of Chriſts death, and to have our eye continually upon Chriſt crucified: That which our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Thomas, Iohn</hi> 20.27. <hi>Put thy finger here, and ſee my hands, and put it forth, and put it into my ſides,</hi> though it were ſpoke there of his materiall wounds, yet every one of us muſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16098:130"/>take it ſpiritually to be ſpoken to our ſelves: wee muſt put our fingers &amp; our hands into the holes of his ſides, we muſt dive deep by our meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecret myſteries of his death, that therby we may become his true beleeving <hi>Diſciples:</hi> the death of Ieſus Chriſt is of all other things moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and profitable, and comfortable to us even in reſpect of all the parts of Religion: Wouldeſt thou behold the love of God towards thee, and know how dearly hee loves thee? See it in the death of Chriſt; God hath given his Sonne not onely to become man for us, but even to dye for us, and to endure the greateſt extremities for us that ever could be thought upon; here is a cleere glaſſe wherein we may behold the height, and the depth, and the length, and the bredth of Gods love towards us: touching the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, every one would faine bee perſwaded of it; but we can never attaine to any ſound per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion thereof, till wee ſearch and ſee thorowly into the death of Chriſt. Gods wrath againſt ſin is infinite, and it paſſeth all our apprehenſion to conceive how hee being ſo juſt and righteous can poſſibly forgive a ſinner, till by our thorow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the death of Chriſt, we finde therein infinite matter of ſatisfaction to Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite juſtice: ſo in our hatred to ſinne, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loath ſinne as we ſhould doe, but by looking into the death of Chriſt, where we ſee that it was ſo loathſome and ſo odious to God, that it did kindle Gods infinite wrath even againſt his owne Sonne, having taken our ſinnes upon him: when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16098:131"/>we conſider this right, then wee begin to fall out with ſinne, and to hate it, and to defie this curſed brat of the Devill, that hath brought the Sonne of God to ſuch a curſed and ſhamefull death: ſo in our mortification, we can never attaine to any true meaſure of it, till we have toyled our ſelves in the due meditation of Chriſts death; when we ſee and conſider that Chriſt himſelfe hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch things, afflictions, temptations, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, death it ſelfe, then we begin to diſpence with our owne mindes, and are contented to ſuffer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, and to mortifie our fleſh, and to crucifie the old man, and with patience to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe and endure all the fiery tryalls. It is the Apoſtles rule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2. ſo in the matter of temptation, the beſt helpe and ſtrength wee have is Chriſt crucified: <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. they overcame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the blood of the Lambe. When the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes, our faith preſently takes hold upon the blood of the Lambe, upon the death of Chriſt; we know that by that Satan was overcome, and ſo by that we have comfort againſt temptation; we conſider we have crucified Chriſt by our ſins already, and therefore we will not harken to him to crucifie him the ſecond time; we conſider that all the promiſes of God are ſealed up unto us in the blood of Chriſt, and thereby wee ſtand faſt ſtriving, and ſuffering, and waiting upon God in faith and patience, and ſo we overcome the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in the blood of the Lambe: ſo in our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of any good thing to come from God, firſt, wee are perſwaded that Chriſt died for us, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16098:131"/>God ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gave him to death for us, and thence we doe comfortably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, how ſhall he not with him give us all things alſo? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. In the matter of our perſeverance we ſtill are fearfull, and faine we would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted how we ſhould perſevere: Meditate ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the death of Chriſt, and there thou ſhalt have ſound comfort for thy perſeverance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10. If God reconcile us to himſelfe by the death of Chriſt when we were his enemies, much more now being reconciled by his blood we ſhall bee ſaved by his life: the Lord that hath ſhewed us ſo great mercy as to bring us out of the ſtate of ſin and damnation when wee were his enemies, will ſurely ſo uphold us being reconciled unto him, that wee ſhall never finally fall into that curſed ſtate againe. Laſtly, for the matter of our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we can never truly repent till we meditate ſoundly upon the death of Chriſt. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They looke upon him whom they have pierced,</hi> and then they lament and be ſory as for their firſt borne; when they ſee him pierced, and conſider that they have pierced him, then they ſhall lament. In that Sermon of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2. whereby ſo many were converted unto God; though many powerfull and profitable inſtructions were delivered, yet they were never thereby ſtung till hee tells them in verſe 36. <hi>This is Ieſus, whom you have crucified;</hi> this went as a dagger to their hearts, for preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were <hi>pricked in their hearts, and cryed out Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> verſe 37. here beginnes repentance, when they ſee they have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16098:132"/>crucified the Lord of life, and ſo it is with us, when once the Holy Ghoſt takes us along into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of Chriſts death, and preſſeth it ſoundly upon our hearts, that we be they that have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lord of life, then we are aſtonied and at our wits end, and then we repent and forethinke our ſelves of the evill we have done: we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtand what a broken heart is, till we find our owne hearts broken with the meditation of the death of Chriſt; when we conſider adviſedly with our ſelves concerning Chriſts ſufferings, what an agony he endured in the garden where he ſweat water as it were drops of blood, and was faine to be comforted by the Angels, and when we thinke with our ſelves that we heare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine as though we were preſent with him; <hi>My ſoule is heavie unto the death;</hi> when wee conſider him how his hands, and feet, and ſides were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and nailed, and pierced upon the Croſſe, and how tender his pretious body was; one goring to him in his ſinleſſe body being more to him than many thouſands to our bodies that are hardned with ſinne; and when we conſider what a fearfull complaint came from him in the anguiſh of his ſoule, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> how can we chuſe if wee have any tenderneſſe of bowells in us in the world, but melt and bee bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in our hearts, and ſpend our ſpirits, in the compaſſionate meditation of ſuch a wofull ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle: but then if we conſider further that all this was endured for us; Innocent Lambe, hee had done nothing amiſſe, but it was all for us and for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16098:132"/>our ſinnes: This ſhould make us more broken hearted at the thought of theſe things; yea if wee had but good nature in us; for who is there among us, who being condemned to dye, if any other ſhould take our death upon him, but wee would bee wonderfully moved in the thought of his death; how much more then ought we to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately moved at the thought of that cruell and ſhamefull death which the Sonne of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for us; I ſay if we had but good nature in us: But conſider laſtly how that he hath not only endured theſe things for us, but that wee in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefull manner have brought all theſe things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſee if we have not juſt cauſe to breake our hearts aſunder with griefe at the thought of Chriſts death; the Iewes hands were the outward inſtruments, our ſinnes the actors, they cryed out on earth to <hi>Pilate, Crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> but our ſinnes cryed our in heaven to God much lowder, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> and that was the voice that prevailed and brought him to that ſhamefull death; when the ſinfull ſoule conſiders this with it ſelfe, I have crucified the Lord of glory, I have killed the Lord of life, then the heart melts and relents, and is gored and pierced with theſe thoughts as ſenſibly as our Saviours body was with the nailes and ſpeare; and the blood did not more freely guſh out of his ſides and body, than bleeding teares doe guſh out of a broken heart and wounded ſpirit of a poore wretched ſinner, thus affected with the meditation of the death of CHRIST.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:16098:133"/>
            <p>Laſtly, this teacheth us what manner of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts death it is wee muſt labour for, it muſt bee both religious and affectionate; the Iewes remember Chriſts death, but not religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, they doe it in ſcorne and hatred of him; Hypocrites remember Chriſts death, and that as a matter of religion as they profeſſe, but it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection, and without truth; but thou that deſireſt to remember Chriſt rightly and ſavingly, thou muſt labour and ſee that thou remember him religiouſly and affectionately; remember it with thankfulneſſe to God, with compaſſion to Chriſts ſufferings, with hatred to thine owne ſinne, with faith in Chriſts pretious blood, and with a true deſire and endeavor to be like to him in his death by thy mortification; how wondrouſly doe men erre, touching this duty, they will ſay we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Chriſt dyed for us all, &amp; ſo paſs it over as a ſleight thing: ſome will goe further, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon it once a yeare, or upon Good Friday ſomewhat more than ordinary; alas this comes farre ſhort of the right remembrance of Chriſts death; whoſoever thou art that lookeſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the death of Chriſt, ſee thou make it thy daily and continuall meditation, and labour to grow acquainted with it every day better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and take this for the concluſion of all, ſo much as thou doſt meditate religiouſly and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately on Chriſts death, ſo much intereſt thou haſt in Chriſt, and in his ſalvation.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now then wee are to come to the handling of the parts of the verſe, and firſt to beginne with the action in the former part of the verſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to conſider theſe two things: Firſt, the parts of the action, <hi>The eating of this bread, and drinking of this cup;</hi> whereby the Apoſtle deſcribes the Lords Supper. Secondly, the frequenting of the action, <hi>As oft as you ſhall eate this bread, and drink this cup:</hi> the parts of the action are the eating of the bread, and the drinking of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cup. To begin with that, there be ſundry other actions of much uſe and ſignificancy in and about the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as namely, the bleſſing of the bread, the breaking of the bread, the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bread, and ſuch like; but becauſe that this here, the eating of the bread, and drinking of the cup, becauſe this action is the accompliſhment of all the reſt, (for all that is done beſides in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16098:136"/>Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the bleſſing of the bread, the breaking and diſtributing of it, tends to this, namely, that the receiver may profitably eate and drinke, and comfortably communicate in theſe holy myſteries) therefore the Apoſtle makes mention of this action onely, as this I ſay being the accompliſhment of the reſt; even the eating of this bread, and drinking of this cup: we are here therefore to conſider of ſome particulars; and the firſt particular that here we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of is this, that the Apoſtle being here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, he doth deſcribe it and ſet it forth by a matter of action, or a matter of uſe: He deſcribes the Sacrament it ſelfe by the uſe of the Sacrament, by the <hi>eating of the bread, and the drinking of the cup.</hi>

               </label> The matter that hence wee are to obſerve, is this, namely, That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as well in regard of the nature of it in it ſelfe, as alſo in regard of the benefit of it to us, doth wholly and altogether conſiſt in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and uſe of the Sacrament, I ſay both for the nature of it, and likewiſe for the benefit of it; for the Apoſtle ſpeakes here of both: he ſpeakes of the nature of this Sacrament, as appeares by the rehearſall of the inſtitution in the three verſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going, wherein the nature of the Sacrament is fully ſet forth: and likewiſe he ſpeaketh of the benefit of the Sacrament, as appeares by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that inſtitution, as alſo by the whole diſcourſe he makes from the ſixe and twentieth verſe to the end of the Chapter. For explication
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16098:137"/>of this doctrine, underſtand, that the Sacrament is then ſaid to he in uſe, when it is uſed, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and received according to Gods owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, then is the Sacrament in uſe, ſo long as the Sacrament is thus in uſe, ſo long it is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Sacrament, and ſo ſoone as this uſe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſo ſoone ceaſeth the nature of the Sacrament in that particular: So for the benefit of it, the Sacrament being thus uſed there is much benefit to be received by it, but without this uſe there is no benefit to be had by it at all; it is true, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Sacrament to the faithfull receiver continues with us after the receiving of it, and we finde benefit, and comfort, and ſweetneſſe by it, but becauſe the benefit doth ariſe wholly and onely from the uſe of the Sacrament, therefore the doctrine ſtands firme, namely, That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, as well in regard of the nature of it in it ſelfe, as alſo in regard of the benefit of it to us, doth wholly and altogether conſiſt in the participation and uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Sacrament both in the nature and uſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> hee ſpeakes of a matter of uſe, <hi>So oft as you eate this bread, and drink this cup, you ſhew the Lords death till he come:</hi> It is not onely to have it, but to eate it and drinke it: For proofe of this point, take Chriſt his example; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Ieſus tooke bread, &amp;c.</hi> there was bread there, and there was wine at the feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over; but the bread and the wine did not make it the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: no, ſaith the Text, <hi>Ieſus tooke it, bleſt it, brake it, and diſtributed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16098:137"/>it, ſaying, Take, eate, this is my body:</hi> So likewiſe he did the cup. This was matter of action on his part, then likewiſe matter of action on the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers part; queſtionleſſe, as hee gave it them, ſo they received it of him, and as he bade them eate it and drinke it, ſo they did eate it and drinke it; this is cleere in <hi>Marke</hi> 14.23. concerning the cup (he ſaith) <hi>They did all drinke of it:</hi> and the ſame is to be underſtood proportionably concerning the bread: here then is all matter of action and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whereunto if ye adde, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is my body, and this is my blood,</hi> and ſo no doubt but they did ſo beleeve it in their meaſure, and accept of it; here ſtill you ſee is all matter of action, both on Chriſt his part, ſaying, and doing, bleſſing, breaking, and diſtributing; and on the receivers part, they tooke it, they eate it, they drank it, and were thankfull to Chriſt for it; this matter of action and uſe it was that gave it the nature of a Sacrament in it ſelfe, and made it beneficiall to them. Agreeable to Chriſt his example was his command, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me, Luke</hi> 22.19. what is it that here Chriſt enjoynes his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? why, ſurely the whole worke of the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that they ſhould doe that which they had ſeene him doe, to the end of the world, they and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ſhould from time to time obſerve it as a perpetuall ordinance, for ſo our Apoſtle expounds the words; whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Doe it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> the Apoſtle explaines it and ſaith, <hi>Doe this as oft as you doe, &amp;c.</hi> giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16098:138"/>that it was not a matter that onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that preſent action wherein Chriſt and his Diſciples were employed, but that it is an action that concernes both Miniſter and receiver to doe in every Sacrament to the worlds end: marke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what termes he doth commend that to them, ſtill he puts it in a matter of action, let this be your uſe and practice, the bread and wine muſt bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, bleſſed, broken, and diſtributed, eaten and drunken, or elſe it is no Sacrament in it ſelfe, nor any benefit to you: ſo in 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 10.16. The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? the cup of bleſſing which wee bleſſe, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? It is not the bread that is the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. but the breaking of the bread, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions as do accompany the Sacrament, that Chriſt hath appointed; and the Apoſtle in the ſeventeenth verſe ſaith, <hi>For wee that are many are one bread, and one body, becauſe we all are partakers of one bread;</hi> ſtill what he ſaith concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſpeakes it in regard of the uſe and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of it: ſo in verſe 21. <hi>You cannot be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Lords table, and of the table of Devills:</hi> ſtill he deſcribes the Lords Table by the uſe and participation of it, and ſo generally throughout all the Scripture: and in the eleventh Chapter, the Apoſtle here ſaith, verſe 20. <hi>When you come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper:</hi> do you think it is to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Sacrament, for one to eat, &amp; not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? no, this is not to eat the Lords ſupper: It is not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16098:138"/>the Lords Supper except it be eaten and in uſe, as the Lord himſelfe hath ordained it. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>And they all continued tn the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and breaking of bread:</hi> there you ſee the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper is ſtill deſcribed by a matter of action and of uſe, by breaking of bread.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> The reaſons: One reaſon is drawne from the uſe and nature of the Sacraments of the former Teſtament, they conſiſted altogether in action and in uſe, for the nature and benefit of them. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, what was it? why, the cutting off the fore-skin of the fleſh: altogether in action. The Paſſeover muſt be killed and eaten: there had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the nature of a Sacrament, unleſſe there had beene killing, and eating; neither was there any benefit by it, without they fed upon it: ſo it is in ours, ours being the ſame in ſubſtance with theirs. The Papiſts, which are our adverſaries, and very hot againſt us in this doctrine, (and it is a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall difference betweene them and us,) they grant (indeed) that in the Sacrament of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Teſtament it was ſo, but ſay they, it prooves not that it ſhould be ſo now in the Sacraments of the new Teſtament; the Sacraments of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Teſtament, they were but ſhadowes, but ours are the ſubſtance; and therefore the reaſon holds not, ſay they. We will not now diſpute whether ours and theirs are the ſame, though we can prove it as cleere as the Sunne at noone day, that they are the ſame in ſubſtance: God forbid that any ſhould thinke that wee ſhould bee ſaved by one meanes, and they by another for matter of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16098:139"/>But not to ſtand upon that. Put the caſe it were ſo, that their Sacraments were ſhadowes, and ours the ſubſtance, the reaſon holds much more ſtrongly: for if it were ſo then in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were but ſhadowes, that they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted altogether in action and uſe, then much more our Sacraments that are in ſubſtance: thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments that have more action and uſe about them, are commonly moſt lively and powerfull; the more action and uſe a Sacrament hath, the more life and power uſually is in the Sacrament to the receiver: unleſſe therefore wee will make the ſhadow to have more life and power than the ſubſtance, the Sacraments of the old Teſtament muſt not conſiſt in action more than the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new; if they yeeld that the nature of them ſtood in the action and uſe of them, then ours muſt doe ſo much more: ſo then the reaſon holds very ſtrong, that the Sacraments of the former Teſtament conſiſted altogether in the uſe and participation of them, and therefore ſo muſt ours.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> The ſecond reaſon is drawne from Baptiſme, the other Sacrament of the new Teſtament: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Lords Supper, a ſweet paire of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments that the Lord Chriſt Ieſus hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; like two breſts for the nouriſhing of the Church to the worlds end: it is ſo in one of theſe breſts, and therefore it is ſo in the other; it is ſo in Baptiſme, therefore it is ſo in the Sacrament of the Lords Surper: it is ſo in Baptiſme, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth both for the nature and benefit of it, in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16098:139"/>uſe of it, the water is not Baptiſme, though it be never ſo hallowed, as the Papiſts ſay; but the waſhing of water, and the uſe of it, that is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; if ſo be that there ſhould be water, and that water ſhould be conſecrated, as they call it, yet if there be not a receiver, or one to be baptiſed, or if there were a party to be baptiſed, and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to baptiſe, yet without he be actually bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, it were no baptiſme: Well, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts grant in the matter of Baptiſme, but it is not true in the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper (ſay they:) Baptiſme conſiſteth onely in uſe; but ſaith the Councill of Trent, It is a great prerogative that God hath vouchſafed to the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, that whereas all other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have their nature and benefit by the uſe of it, yet this Sacrament of the Lords ſupper hath this prerogative, to retaine the nature and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, when the uſe of it ceaſeth. This they ſay, if they could prove it; but they cannot ſhew us any ſuch prerogative out of the word, thus to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the ſacrament of the Lords Supper above the ſacrament of Baptiſme. We know this, that in each of theſe ſacraments every faithfull belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth receive Chriſt and all his benefits, I ſay, in Baptiſme, as well as in the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. By Baptiſme we put on Chriſt: and what can we doe more in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords ſupper? Likewiſe by Baptiſme we are incorporated into Chriſt, into the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. What can be done more in the Sacrament of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16098:140"/>than this. <hi>By Baptiſme we are waſhed and renewed by the Holy Ghoſt, Tit.</hi> 3.5. What can be done more in the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, than is in Baptiſme? Therefore if ſo be that the Sacrament of Baptiſme bee of no force nor benefit without the uſe, why ſhould the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper be of force and benefit to us without uſe? Againe, if the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper bee of force without uſe, why then ſhould not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme? There can be no reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it, it is nothing elſe but a fancy or dreame of theirs, in thinking that Chriſt is bodily preſent in the Lords ſupper, and that drives them to ſpeak many ſtrange things contrary to all reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> The third reaſon is this: There muſt be a due proportion betweene the Sacrament and that which is repreſented by the ſacrament: now, what is repreſented by the ſacrament of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Why, Chriſt himſelfe, the death of Ieſus Chriſt; and the death of Chriſt Ieſus conſiſteth altogether both for the nature and benefit of it, in matter of action and uſe. Firſt for the nature of Chriſt his death: Chriſt had not dyed unleſſe his body had beene broken, and his blood ſhed. Then for the benefit of the death of Chriſt, no man ſhall have any benefit by it any further than they apply it, and receive it by the hand of faith: If it be ſo then in the thing repreſented by the ſacrament, then it is ſo in the ſacrament it ſelfe. And ſurely they that make the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper to be a matter of ſaving benefit being out of uſe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16098:140"/>they advance it above the death of Chriſt, becauſe that is not in force, but ſo farre as it is in uſe and action.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> The fourth reaſon may bee drawne from ſuch things as the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper is compared unto. Firſt, it is compared to a plaiſter, becauſe that it is as it were a ſpirituall plaiſter to cure our ſpirituall ſores, ſinnes, and infirmities, through the ordinance and bleſſing of God: wee know in a plaiſter there muſt bee uſed many ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and ingredients, yet all they doe not make a plaiſter, till they bee tempered together by Art, elſe they make none: well, when they are ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, what good will this doe to him that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, without he apply it to the ſore? ſurely no benefit at all: it is not a plaiſter, at leaſt not in the benefit of it to him, no further than he applyes it unto the ſore. So likewiſe for the matter of a ſeale; the ſacraments are compared unto ſeales: put the caſe there be a ſeale, and there bee wax, and the ſeale be put unto the wax, yet if they bee not put unto the writing, it gives no aſſurance of benefit to him to whom the conveyance is made. Laſtly, in the matter of a feaſt; as the ſacrament is called a feaſt, let there be much meat, and many gueſts at the feaſt, yet all this makes it not a feaſt, unleſſe they doe eate and drinke; but it is their meeting, their eating and drinking that makes it a feaſt, and makes it likewiſe beneficiall to them that eate of it. If it be ſo in theſe things, then it is ſo in the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper: though there bee bread &amp; wine, and it be broken and poured forth,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16098:141"/>yet notwithſtanding if it bee not uſed, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and drunken, it hath neither the nature of a ſacrament, nor the benefit of a ſacrament to any of us.</p>

Firſt of a Popiſh doctrine. The Popiſh Church holds and maintaines very ſtiffely, That the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper ſtill continues in the nature of the ſacrament, and the bread ſtill continues the body of Chriſt after the uſe of it ceaſeth: and the Councill of Trent holds all other accurſed that are contrary minded. For their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we regard them not, for <hi>a curſe cauſleſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>flyes like a Bird in the ayre that leaves no impreſsion behinde it:</hi> ſo their curſe upon us being cauſeleſſe, we are never the worſe for it. But for their doctrine, that is falſe and damnable, that the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper continues to be a ſacrament when the uſe is finiſhed. There is no warrant, nor colour of warrant for it from the Word; never any Papiſt did, nor can alledge any argument or tittle out of Scripture to prove this: we for our parts have proved it by many places of Scripture, that the ſacrament is a ſacrament meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the uſe of it; and the nature and benefit of it conſiſteth in the uſe and participation of it; wee finde the Scripture never ſpeakes of it otherwiſe but as an action and uſe, and therfore ſee whether they are the ſheepe of Chriſt, or we: <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce, and follow me, &amp;c.</hi> we have the word of God to goe before us, Chriſt and his Apoſtles
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16098:141"/>ſay ſo. That the nature of a ſacrament conſiſteth in the matter of action and uſe, thus we reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied &amp; go no further; we will not hearken to the voice of ſtrangers, that go farther and define what it is after, to ſay that it is beneficiall as well after as before: ſee if they deſerve not that curſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt us. So much for their opinion. Now for their practice grounded upon this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, to give you a taſte; firſt, in ſhewing of the ſacrament; the ſacrament after it is conſecrated, being lifted up by the Prieſt, and beheld by the people, oh this is a great part of Gods worſhip with them: It is a ſtrange thing that men ſhould be ſo beſotted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they keepe it, and reſerve it uſually in a box till it be mouldy and unſavoury, and yet ſtill they hold it to bee the Lords body, and (as they ſay) they doe many miracles with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they doe not onely thus, but they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it about with them, when they travell in the ſtreets and other places, as a preſervative againſt ſickneſſe and other evills: theſe and ſuch other like fopperies are uſed in the Popiſh Church, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this falſe ground, that being once dedicated to the uſe of the ſacrament, as they ſuppoſe, it muſt needs alwayes have the ſame force and power, ſo long as it continues: wee may referre it to the judgement of any indifferent underſtanding man to judge, whether hee thinketh they or wee doe come neareſt to the meaning, and true inſtitution of Chriſt. We are ſure that Chriſt tooke bread, and commanded us ſo to doe, to take the bread,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16098:142"/>to bleſſe it, breake it, and diſtribute it; but wee are ſure that he never commanded it to be caryed about, for any ſuch ſuperſtitious uſes as they doe. I doe not doubt but there be many that have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to travell into places where theſe and ſuch like ſuperſtitions are uſed, if they have any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or any taſte of Religion, they will grow into a greater hatred and deteſtation of Popery in ſeeing that which they doe, than wee doe, or can doe by the hearing of theſe things: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any ſhall come to ſee any ſuch things, labour to be fenced with this preſervative; let us know, the ſacrament is excellent in the uſe of it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is of no force after the uſe, but to put any ſuperſtitious holineſſe in it: that it is in force after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, we have no warrant for it from the Word, and therefore let us hate it as an abominable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>

What is the reaſon? Surely the fault is their owne, becauſe God hath appointed it to be a matter of action, and doing, and they perform not thoſe actions that God hath enjoyned them unto, they doe not apply Chriſt to them by faith, they eate, and drinke, and yet doe not actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne the Lords body. So much of that firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that is to be conſidered, namely, That the Apoſtle deſcribing the nature of the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, hee deſcribes it in regard of the uſe and benefit of it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point that we are to conſider, is this, (namely) that whereas the Apoſtle here in this ſpeech makes mention of the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the bread and the wine, hee calls them by their owne proper names, <hi>eate this bread, and drinke this cup,</hi> that is, this wine; hee calls them, I ſay, by their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16098:143"/>owne proper names, that is, by the names of the ſigne, not by the names of the thing ſignified: hee doth not ſay, As often as ye ſhall eate this body, and drinke this blood; but, <hi>As often as ye eate this bread, and drinke this cup;</hi> and this he doth after the bleſſing and conſecration to this ſacred uſe, and that appeares by the circumſtance of the Text: For looke what bread our Saviour ſpake of in the former words, that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of here, ſeeing he inferres it by way of reaſon. Now that which Chriſt ſpake of in the verſe going before, was bread, after it was bleſſed and conſecrated, bread, in the uſe of the Sacrament, and ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it bread ſtill: and ſo likewiſe it appears plainly by the whole drift of this part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the bread in the uſe of the Sacrament, namely, after conſecration.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> The point of doctrine that hence wee are to obſerve, is this, namely, That howſoever the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of bread and wine uſed in the Sacrament be conſecrated by the inſtitution and bleſſing of God, to a ſpirituall and ſacred uſe, yet they are not thereby changed out of their nature and ſubſtance, but ſtill, for their nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they continue the ſame creatures as before, the ſame bread, and the ſame wine; bread ſtill, as it was bread before. No man will ſuppoſe that the Apoſtle doth nick-name them. Seeing then the Apoſtle calls it bread, after the bleſſing and conſecration of it, and the Apoſtle cannot be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to nick-name them, therefore out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it muſt be ſo reputed, that it continues in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16098:144"/>nature of bread after conſecration: the Apoſtle doth not call it ſo here onely once in this chapter, but three ſeverall times, 26, 27, 28. verſes: if ſo be he had ſpoke it but once, we might have thought it to be an improper ſpeech: but ſpeaking ſo of it often, this ſhewes it is the true name &amp; title that is due unto them, and that they are the very ſame creatures as they were before: And the Apoſtle doth not onely call them ſo here, but elſewhere, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.17. <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c?</hi> mark, he calls it bread even in the breaking, or in the uſe of the Sacrament: It is bleſſed before it is broken; and it is bread when it is broken: <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> therefore it is bread after the bleſſing. Now the Apoſtle goes further, and ſaith in the ſeventeenth verſe, <hi>For we that are many, are one bread, and one body, becauſe we are all partakers of one bread:</hi> The Apoſtle doth not onely call it bread, while it is in the Miniſters hand, but when the people receive it, and partake of it, he ſaith, <hi>you are partakers of bread:</hi> ſtill it is bread, notwithſtanding the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And though by the bleſſing and inſtitution of Chriſt, and the promiſe of God, it be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a holy uſe, it ſtill continues bread, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the nature and ſubſtance thereof. It is ſtrange to ſee how miſerably the Papiſts do ſhuffle and ſhift to avoid this very argument in this place, becauſe the Apoſtle is ſo plaine and expreſſe that it is bread. To give you a taſte of it, becauſe it is a matter of great controverſie betweene us and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16098:144"/>the Church of Rome: they would avoid the force of this reaſon, therefore you ſhall ſee how they expound it: This bread, ſay ſome of them, (I will not tell you of the meaneſt, but ſome of the beſt and greateſt Champions amongſt them) it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led bread, not becauſe it is bread, but becauſe it was bread, by a trope and figure, becauſe it was made of Bread. Marke, it is called ſo by a trope and figure: Vnderſtand thus much, when as wee ſay that the words of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> are to bee underſtood figuratively, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime againſt us for it: What (ſay they) will you have a trope and a figure in the Sacrament? that is ridiculous: and yet to ſerve their owne turne they will have tropes even in the Sacrament. But to goe to the ſenſe of their anſwer: This is called bread (ſay they) becauſe it was bread: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.5. <hi>The blinde receive ſight, the halt goe;</hi> marke, ſay they, they are called blinde, though they receive their ſight, becauſe they were blinde before; and they are called the halt, becauſe they were ſo before, though they goe now: ſo this is called bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was bread before, but not ſo now, but meerely the body of Chriſt. Take it ſo: apply this expoſition to this place, and then ſee what a ſpeech they will have the Apoſtle to make; As oft as ye eate this bread, which before was bread, but now is not, you ſhew forth the Lords death till hee come, it was ſo, but it is not ſo: why then ſhould the Apoſtle tell them it is bread? The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is very unlike: they were called blinde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were blinde before; but that blindneſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16098:145"/>which they had before is taken away, and ſo they are ſaid now to ſee. If they can ſhew us that the ſubſtance which was in this bread before, is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed by the words of conſecration, then we ſhall beleeve that it is called bread, becauſe it was bread; but elſe we muſt beleeve that as it was bread before, ſo it is bread ſtill; and is ſo called here by the Apoſtle, becauſe it is now bread in regard of the preſent ſtate of the thing. Againe, they ſay this bread is called bread, becauſe it is like bread, not becauſe it is bread, becauſe it hath the forme and faſhion of it: As the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was called a Serpent, though it was but in the forme of a Serpent: whereby they make the Apoſtle to ſay thus: As oft as you ſhall eate this bread, which indeed is no bread, only it hath the outward forme of bread: is not this a ſenſleſſe ſpeech? They give another anſwer; It may bee called bread (ſay they) after the Hebrew phraſe, becauſe it is food; for they call all food by the name of bread, becauſe bread is the principall food. I anſwer, they call temporall food by the name of bread, but let it be ſhewed that they call all ſpirituall food by the name of bread, for they ſay it is ſpirituall food which the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of: but the cup being here mentioned as well as the bread, doth cleerly anſwer this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Laſtly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. doth not Chriſt (ſay they) call himſelfe bread? &amp; I hope that is not meant of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, but ſpirituall bread. It is true, Chriſt calls himſelfe bread, but withall he gives other titles, whereby to know it to be heavenly bread: as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16098:145"/>where he ſaith, <hi>I am the living bread,</hi> or, <hi>The bread that came downe from heaven:</hi> but this is not ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſuch as they did eate in their owne meales, and at their owne Tables: there he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of himſelfe as the heavenly and ſpirituall bread: But this the Apoſtle ſpeakes of here, is of the bread of the Lords Table: <hi>He that eates of that bread ſhall never dye, Iohn</hi> 6.50. but a man may eate of this bread, and yet dye for ever, as verſe 29.</p>

Doe wee thinke that God doth ſo delude us as oft as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſacrament, to make us beleeve that there is bread and wine, when there is none? will God deceive us when we come to doe him ſervice in the uſe of his owne ordinances?

We need no other place againſt this dreame of theirs than this in hand, that the Apoſtle calls it by the name of bread after conſecration. And this ſhould teach us much more to hate and loath that groſſe practice of theirs in adoring the Sacrament; and indeed it comes from this Tranſubſtantiation: Tranſubſtantiation is the mother of adoration: becauſe they thinke the body of Chriſt is there
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16098:147"/>bodily preſent, therefore they adore it: horrible Idolatry! the Apoſtle cals it bread, and they make it their God: and therefore judge you whether we doe not juſtly challenge the Papiſts, that they worſhip a breaden god: that which the Holy Ghoſt calls bread, that they worſhip as God, and therefore they worſhip a breaden god: this is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Idolatry, &amp; this is a main matter of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

            <head>THE FOVRTEENTH LECTVRE VPON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORDS SVPPER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are now to make our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion into the argument of the Lords Supper, for our better and fitter preparation unto the participation of that holy Sacrament the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as oft as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, you ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we divided this verſe into two parts: Firſt, here is mentioned an action performed, the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Lords Supper, in the former part of the verſe, <hi>As oft as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup.</hi> Secondly, here is a caution and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it is to be performed withall, in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>You ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> Concerning the action wee noted two things: Firſt, the parts of it; and then the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16098:149"/>of it: the parts of it, <hi>to eate this bread, and drink this cup;</hi> the frequenting of it, <hi>So oft as you eate it, you ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> We have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne with the parts of it already, and therein we have ſhewed how that the Apoſtle deſcribing the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, ſets it forth by the uſe of it, not by having of it, or by having acceſſe to it, but by having the uſe of it, by eating the bread, and drinking the cup. Thence we noted That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in matter of action and uſe. Then againe we noted in the ſecond place, That whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here ſpeakes of the elements of bread and wine, as they are in uſe in the Sacrament, he calls them by their ordinary names, the bread by the name of bread, and the wine by the name of cup: from hence we gathered this doctrine; That even after the words of conſecration and bleſſing, ſtill the bread and the wine for their nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are the ſame as they were before, ſtill they remaine bread and wine. So farre we proceeded. Now we are to proceed further. Thirdly, then we are here to conſider, that the Apoſtle here ſpeaking of theſe elements of bread and wine as they are in uſe in the Sacrament of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he ſets them forth by a note of excellency, this bread, and this cup, for by the cup is meant wine, <hi>as oft as you eate this bread, and drinke this cup,</hi> he ſets them forth by a note of excellencie.</p>
            <p>As in all things we muſt keepe a meane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going too farre, or comming too ſhort, ſo ſpecially in matters of religion we muſt be ſure
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16098:149"/>to keepe on the right way, without turning either to the right hand, or to the left; we muſt take all matters of Religion in that very preciſe and true ſtraine that the Lord himſelfe hath ſet upon them: we are apt enough to erre as well on the one ſide as on the other, as well on the right ſide as on the left, and to erre on either ſide is alike dangerous. So it is in other matters of Religion; and ſo it is in our eſtimation of theſe elements of bread and wine that are in uſe in the Lords Supper: ſome doe erre on the right hand in their eſtimation of them, thinking too highly of them, as the Papiſts doe, that the bread is corporally the very body of Chriſt, that the wine is corporally the very blood of Chriſt: on the other ſide, others there be that erre on the left hand in their eſtimation of them, they eſteeme too meanly and baſely of them, as the prophane people of the world, they generally eſteeme the bread and wine at the Lords Table, no better than the bread and wine at their owne table. To meet with both theſe errors, and ſo to keepe our hearts upright in the profeſſion of Gods truth herein, the Apoſtle in this ſhort ſpeech gives us a good caveat and preſervative. And firſt that we may not thinke too highly of them, and ſo erre on the right hand, as the Papiſts doe, the Apoſtle ſtill calls them bread and wine, ſhewing that in the nature and ſubſtance of them they are the ſame as they were before: next, that wee might not erre on the left hand, and thinke too meanly and baſely of them, as the prophane people doe, hee extolls them by a note of excellency, <hi>this bread,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16098:150"/>and this wine;</hi> though the bread be but bread in it ſelfe, and the wine be but wine in it ſelfe, yet hee ſpeakes with a kind of grace and majeſty of ſpeech, <hi>this bread, &amp; this cup;</hi> as ſingling them out by a note of difference from ordinary bread &amp; wine, becauſe they are dedicated to a ſacred and holy uſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are advanced above all other bread and wine whatſoever; <hi>As oft as you eate this bread, and drinke this cup,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>you ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The doctrine hence to be raiſed, is this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That howſoever it bee that the elements of bread and wine that are uſed in the Lords Supper are in nature and in ſubſtance the ſame creatures as they were before, yet notwithſtanding, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that ſame ſacred and holy uſe that they are conſecrated and dedicated unto to bee made parts of the Sacrament, in this reſpect they are things of farre greater excellency than all ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things of that kinde are: this bread is farre more excellent bread in reſpect of the uſe of it, than any other; and this wine is farre more excellent wine in reſpect of the uſe of it, than any other; this is the reach of the Apoſtle, in that he ſpeakes ſo emphatically, <hi>this</hi> bread, and <hi>this</hi> cup. Marke the doctrine; howſoever it be that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread &amp; wine that are uſed in the Lords Supper, are in nature and ſubſtance the ſame crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as they were before, yet notwithſtanding in reſpect of that ſacred and holy uſe that they are conſecrated and dedicated unto to be made parts of the Sacrament, in this reſpect they are far more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16098:150"/>excellent than any other ordinary creatures of that kinde; this bread is more excellent than any other bread, and this wine dedicated to this uſe, is farre more excellent than any other wine: We ſhall not need to goe for proofe of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine any further than this Chapter: This Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affordeth us very pregnant proofes of it. If we marke the Apoſtle, he points out here three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betweene our ordinary food that we have at our meales, and this extraordinary food that we have at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The firſt is in the 20. and 21. verſe, <hi>When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper, for every man when they ſhould eate, taketh his owne ſupper afore, and one is hungry, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is drunken.</hi> Our ordinary food is our owne food, our ordinary ſupper is our owne ſupper, but this extraordinary food is not our owne food, but the Lords food, it is not our owne ſupper, but the Lords Supper: When we come to eate of this bread, and to drinke of this cup, it is the Lords Supper: as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Look how much difference there is betweene that which is your owne, and that which is the Lords, ſo much difference there is between your owne bread and wine, which you have at your owne Table, and that bread and wine which you have at the Lords Table; and looke how much you preferre that which is the Lords, before that which is your owne, ſo much you muſt preferre the bread of the Lords Table, before your owne bread; yea, the bread and the wine in the Sacrament, if it be not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16098:151"/>received with this reverent acceptation, that it is the Lords bread, and the Lords wine, ſurely they are not the Lords unto us, but our owne; no more benefit comes to us by them, than by our owne bread and wine at our owne table: and this is the reach of the Apoſtle in theſe two verſes: there is the firſt difference, this is the Lords, and the other is our owne; and as we prefer that which is the Lords, before our owne, ſo we muſt preferre the bread of the Lords Table before the bread of our owne table.</p>
            <p>The ſecond difference which the Apoſtle points at, is this in the 22. verſe, <hi>Have you not houſes to eate and to drinke in? deſpiſe you the Church of God, and ſhame them that have not?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, the ordinary food which you have, why, you have it in your owne houſes; but this food you have it in the Church of God, your bread and your wine is home-food, but this bread and this wine is Church-food; your bread and your wine is for your children, ſervants, and family, but this bread and this wine is for Gods children, for his houſe, and family. I hope there is none of you but doe eſteeme more highly of the houſe of God than you doe of your owne houſes, and therefore by that learne to eſteeme of theſe myſteries, the bread and wine in the Church of God, above that which you receive at your owne houſes.</p>
            <p>The third and the laſt difference is that which is in this 26.27. and 28. verſes: where the Apoſtle calls it <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this cup, the cup of the Lord;</hi> it caries an implication: I ſay that there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16098:151"/>betweene this bread and other bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this wine and other wine: other bread and wine they are but naturall or artificiall things, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only for the worke of nature; but this bread and this wine that is in uſe in the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, over and beſides that naturall and artificiall face that is ſet upon them, over and beſides that which they have in nature, theſe have a ſupernaturall condition impoſed upon them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> above, whereby they are advanced above any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread and wine, and made ſerviceable for the worke of Grace.</p>
            <p>So then you ſee, the Apoſtle having pointed out theſe three differences, it makes the Doctrine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleare, That the bread and wine which is in uſe in the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, is far more excellent than any other bread and wine whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. To confirme this, let us adde to the words of the Scholar, the words of the Maſter, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19, 20. it is ſaid there, that our Saviour tooke the Cup, and ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood.</hi> See how fitly <hi>Paul</hi> the ſcholar imitates and followes Chriſt his Maſter. Chriſt himſelfe had ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood: Paul</hi> calls it <hi>This bread,</hi> and <hi>this Cup. This Cup</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is the New Teſtament in my blood.</hi> We muſt take notice that our Saviour was then at ſupper; I, not at an ordinary ſupper, but eating the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: that ſupper being ended, hee ſaith, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood.</hi> He tooke the ſame Cup, and being to dedicate it to the uſe of the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, ſaith, <hi>This Cup is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16098:152"/>the New Teſtament in my blood.</hi> Giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the bread and wine which are in uſe in the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, they are farre better, and of far greater uſe and excellency than any of our ordinary food, yea better then the bread and wine that wee have not onely at our owne feaſts, but even at any other feaſts of the Lord. Therefore well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this cup,</hi> advancing it by a note of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency above all other bread and wine whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> The firſt Reaſon is in regard of the owner of it, namely, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; it doth belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, it is his bread. And that is the thing that the Apoſtle notes in the 27. verſe, <hi>Whoſoever eateth this bread, and drinketh the cup of the Lord unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> Hee changeth his ſtyle, and whereas hee calls it <hi>This cup,</hi> here in the 26. verſe, and ſo afterwards ver. 28. he calls it verſe 27. <hi>The cup of the Lord:</hi> giving us to underſtand, that therefore it is <hi>this bread,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Lords bread: therefore it is <hi>this cup,</hi> a cup of excellencie, becauſe it is the cup of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Generally wee doe eſteeme things to bee ſo much the more excellent, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the excellencie of him that ownes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that they belong unto. Why Chriſt is far above al excellencies, principalities, powers, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever; we muſt needs therfore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this bread and this wine is farre more excellent then any other in regard of the owner of them. It is true indeede, that Chriſt is the owner
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16098:152"/>of all the Creatures, they are his, becauſe he made them; it is very true: yea, but yet we muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice here of a further, &amp; a ſpeciall owing of theſe creatures, whereby they belong to Chriſt Ieſus, and that in many reſpects: Firſt, beſides that they are his creatures as other things are; theſe are Chriſt his owne by inſtitution, becauſe Chriſt hath inſtituted them by his owne Word, and likewiſe by his owne fact, that they ſhould bee a part of his owne ſaving Ordinance. Secondly, they are his owne by repreſentation, for as they are a part of his Ordinances, ſo they are a lively picture of Chriſt Ieſus, whereby he repreſents and tenders to the eye of every faithfull beleever all that ever he hath done, and ſuffered for them. They are his owne by repreſentation, as <hi>Caeſars</hi> picture is his, becauſe it carryes his reſemblance; ſo this Bread, and this Wine is Chriſts, becauſe it hath the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Chriſt, and repreſents unto the faithfull Chriſt Ieſus, and the whole worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, they are his owne by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the bread and wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, are as it were the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, wherby Chriſt Ieſus doth communicate, and convey, and worke himſelfe through the lively o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Holy Ghoſt into the hearts of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true beleever, that doth receive him worthily, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of bleſsing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? the bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> So then you ſee, the bread and the wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is Chriſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16098:153"/>his owne by a ſpecialty, by way of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> The ſecond reaſon why they are ſo excellent, is, becauſe of the bleſſing upon them when they are in uſe in the Sacrament: our Savior himſelfe hath bleſſed them with his owne mouth, word, and fact, at his firſt inſtitution. Likewiſe, hee hath commanded the Apoſtles and Miniſters from time to time to bleſſe them ever in the uſe of the Sacrament: our Saviours bleſſing them at firſt, doth thereby convey a bleſſing to all Sacraments of that kinde that ever ſhall be afterward uſed according to Gods Ordinance; if the firſt fruits be holy, then ſo is the whole lumpe: the firſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being inſtituted by Chriſt, and the creatures bleſſed by him, he doth thereby convey a bleſſing neceſſarily upon thoſe creatures in the right uſe of the Sacrament to the worlds end; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the commandement that our Saviour gave to the Apoſtles and Miniſters, that they ſhould bleſſe thoſe creatures, it implyes a promiſe, that when Miniſters pray for a bleſſing upon them according to Gods Ordinance, God will bee preſent with them to bleſſe them: and therefore they (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the bleſſing) are more excellent then any other. But do we not bleſſe other creatures, as our ordinary food? Yes, but this is a ſpeciall bleſſing after another manner; ſuch a bleſſing, as by which they are dedicated to the ſervice of God. Marke how the Evangeliſts &amp; the Apoſtles ſpeake of the bleſſing of theſe, <hi>Marke,</hi> 14.22. ſaith, that <hi>he gave thankes; Matthew</hi> ſaith, ch. 26. v. 26. <hi>He bleſſed them.</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:16098:153"/>What ſhall we ſay, doe theſe differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? In the generall both agree, though in maner of ſpeech there be ſome difference: It is true, the main actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that our Savior was then imployed in, the bleſſing of the Creatures, was invocation, and thankeſgiving; and thence it is ſaid by <hi>Marke, He gave thanks:</hi> yet it was not barely a thankeſgiving, but ſuch a thankeſgiving, as whereby he procured a bleſſing upon them, that they ſhould be effectual not onely for nouriſhing purpoſes, as at our owne meales, but eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſaving purpoſes to every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiver: It was ſuch a thankeſgiving, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they were dedicated, &amp; conſecrated, as outward parts of Gods worſhip, to his owne immediate ſervice; and thence it is ſaid by <hi>Matthew,</hi> that <hi>Hee bleſſed them.</hi> And that wee may know it was more then ordinary, the Text ſhewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27. that he having bleſſed or given thankes for the Bread, he gave thankes alſo for the Wine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a ſeverall bleſſing upon each of them; whereas ordinarily our bread, and our drinke are both bleſſed together by one and the ſame giving of thankes.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> The third reaſon, they are excellent in regard of the uſe that they are dedicated unto; namely, to be ſignes, &amp; ſeales, &amp; pledges of the covenant of grace; that bread, &amp; that wine that do aſſure us of the favour of God, and of the forgiveneſſe of our ſins, &amp; of the grace of ſanctification, &amp; of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation into Chriſt Ieſus, do well deſerve to be called this bread, and this wine, as being of a higher degree, and of a better ſtampe then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> The uſe teacheth us matter of reſolution in our judgements. Concerning the bread and the wine in the Lords Supper, ſometimes we read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that they are ſpoken but meanly of, and ſometimes very highly of: ſometimes it is onely called bread, and ſometimes the body of Chriſt: ſometimes it is onely called the Cup, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the blood of Chriſt. Here is reſolution of judgement ariſing from this doctrine: Wee muſt diſtinguiſh betweene the nature of the thing, and the uſe of the thing, and then the matter is very cleare: In the nature it is but bread and wine, but in the uſe it is the body and blood of Chriſt. If we would tye our ſelves to this rule, alwayes wiſely diſcerning betwixt the nature of the thing, and the uſe, it would ſtabliſh us well in the matter of the Sacrament, we ſhould be able to anſwer the exceptions of the Papiſts concerning tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is bread in the nature of the thing it ſelfe; yet the body of Chriſt in the uſe: it is wine, yet it is the blood of Chriſt; wine in its nature, but yet the blood of Chriſt in regard of the uſe of it.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> The third uſe is matter of in inſtruction, teaching us firſt how religiouſly, reverently, and preciouſly we ought to eſteeme of theſe holy and heavenly Myſteries, wee muſt labour to be lifted up in our hearts and thoughts to a higher ſtraine, when wee come to partake or but to thinke of this bread, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of nature: wee muſt not be earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnally minded to behold the bread and the wine onely with our bodily eyes: but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded, to behold them with the eye of faith, to be <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this wine,</hi> dedicated to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſacred uſe. Let no man thinke in his heart, it is but bread, and it is but wine, and what gteat matter can you make of it? I anſwere to them as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to thoſe in the 16. of <hi>Exodus</hi> verſ. 15. ſpeaking of <hi>Manna,</hi> they ſeemed to make light of it, <hi>What is this? Moſes</hi> ſaith unto them, <hi>This is the bread that God hath given you to eate, that you might live.</hi> So, though this be but bread and wine, yet this is the bread, and this is the wine, that GOD
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16098:155"/>hath given us, to eate, and to drinke, and to feed not our bodies onely as <hi>Manna</hi> did, but even our ſoules to eternall life.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Then againe it teacheth us, not to ſtay there in the admiration of theſe things, as many doe, but know that you muſt goe on, and as you eſteem reverently of it, ſo likewiſe earneſtly and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſire it. Wee know for our parts, that the beſt things wee moſt of all deſire, ſpecially in the matter of our dyet; the beſt, the fineſt, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, &amp; the wholſomeſt bread: ſo for wine the beſt, the quickeſt, the neateſt, and the richeſt wine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired moſt. Oh that wee were as wiſe for the dyet and welfare of our ſoules, as wee are for the dyet of our bodies. This bread is the beſt bread, the fineſt, the whiteſt, and the wholſomeſt bread that ever man did or can eate: this wine is the beſt, the quickeſt, the neateſt, and the richeſt wine that ever any man did, or can drinke: therefore how ſhould wee be ſtirred up with an earneſt and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent deſire after this bread and this wine.</p>
            <p>Mark and minde that of the Apoſtles, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.34. Chriſt had told them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. that the bread of God is hee which commeth downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven, and giveth life unto the world: then they ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Lord evermore give us of this bread.</hi> That was ſpoken of Chriſt abſolutely in himſelfe, but this is ſpoken of Chriſt in a ſacramentall ſenſe; let us therefore follow their example, and let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the excellency of this bread ſtirre us up to deſire it earneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y, to pray that God would evermore give us this bread: and this would make
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16098:155"/>us not come once a moneth, but every day if it were poſſible: our little comming to it, ſheweth our little deſire of it.</p>
            <p>But to goe further; wee muſt not onely reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently eſteeme of it, and earneſtly deſire it, but alſo labour to be worthy receivers of it. Whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee come to the Lords Table, let every one of us ſee we bring a pure ſoule and a cleane heart, purged from the leaven of all maliciouſneſſe, and cleanſed from the ſinfull humours of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, emptied of the filthy and noyſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the world and of the old man. Let us come with a pure heart, and a ſanctified ſoule, a cleane veſſell to put this holy and ſanctified foode into. For otherwiſe, if thou come as an unworthy receiver, all will bee marred, that is to ſay, both the bread, and the receiver; the unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver defiles this ſanctified bread unto himſelfe; and this ſanctified bread ſhall condemne the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver: ſo both ſhall be marred. But when as there comes a ſweet veſſell for this ſweet food to be put into, then theſe will ſweetly agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>As there is a marke of excellency ſet upon the bread and the cup, it is <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this cup,</hi> that is to ſay, ſanctified bread, and a ſanctified cup: ſo there muſt anſwerably be a marke of excellency ſet upon the receiver; thou muſt be <hi>this</hi> receiver, that is to ſay, a ſanctified receiver, a prepared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, a worthy receiver. And when theſe things ſhal thus meet together, then there is a ſweet mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; then is <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this wine</hi> well beſtowed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16098:156"/>upon <hi>this</hi> receiver, and then <hi>this</hi> receiver is well refreſhed and well comforted, with <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this wine.</hi> Dogs and ſwine, that is to ſay, they that continue in their ſinnes and filthineſſe, they are not to come to bee made partakers of theſe holy things, and pretious pearles of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, wee muſt not ſtay here neyther, but we muſt goe one ſtep further. As we muſt reverently eſteeme of it, and earneſtly deſire it, and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive it; So likewiſe we muſt in the laſt place thankfully acknowledge the goodneſſe of GOD, and magnifie his great love towards us, that is pleaſed to invite and admit ſuch unworthy gueſts as we are, to ſuch pretious bread and wine as this is. Bleſſe GOD the Father in thy heart, that hath ſent thee <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this wine.</hi> Bleſſe GOD the Sonne, that hath given thee <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this cup.</hi> Bleſſe GOD the Holy-Ghoſt, that is alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the beleeving receiver, by the continuall aſſiſtance of his power &amp; grace, to make <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this cup</hi> through his lively operation to bee the bread of ſpirituall ſtrength, and the wine of ſpirituall comfort, the bread and wine of life, and of ſalvation, to every faithfull receiver. So much ſhall ſerve to have ſpoken of this third thing.</p>
            <p>It followes, <hi>As oft as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, you ſhew the Lords death till hee come.</hi> Marke here, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and participation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, couples both theſe together, the bread and the wine, the eating of the bread, and the drinking of the wine: he doth not ſay, As oft
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16098:156"/>as you eate this bread, or drinke this cup, as if they might bee divided one from the other; but, as oft as you eate this bread and drinke this cup, joyning theſe inſeparably together in the uſe of the Sacrament.</p>

               </label> The matter of Doctrine is this, namely, That the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper is not to bee adminiſtred in any one kinde onely; that is to ſay, not in the bread without the wine, nor in the wine without the bread, but in both kindes, in the bread, and in the wine both together. Marke the doctrine that is raiſed from hence, in that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle joynes both theſe together. Hence obſerve, that the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper is not to be adminiſtred in any one kinde onely, &amp;c. If the Apoſtle had left out the bread or the cup, it had beene another matter, but hee names them both, and therby gives us the rule that the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper is to bee adminiſtred in both kindes, in the bread and in the wine, both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The inſtitution of the Sacrament by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour yeelds us a double proofe of this doctrine, each of them very ſufficient, and each of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleare; the firſt is our Saviours practice, and the ſecond is our Saviours commandement. Firſt, concerning our Saviours practice, it is ſaid in theſe places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. that our Saviour tooke the bread and the wine, and gave it to his Diſciples. Our Saviour himſelfe he adminiſtred it not in one kine only, but in both kindes. Now the rule is this, that our Saviours
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16098:157"/>example in all matters of ſubſtance, in all his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances muſt be the rule that we muſt follow: this is a matter of ſubſtance concerning this ſaving Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lords ſupper, and therefore his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this is to be followed, that himſelfe did adminiſter the Sacrament in both kindes; and his example muſt be our rule, therefore we muſt doe ſo too.</p>
            <p>The ſecond proofe is from his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for how ſoever it be that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> mentions it not, yet <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 22. and <hi>Paul</hi> here mentioneth an expreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, that Chriſt gave charge that they ſhould doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him; as he ſaith of the bread, ſo the ſame he ſaith of the wine: that is, whatſoever you ſee me do in matter of ſubſtance, the ſame you muſt do as long as the world ſtandeth: Chriſt did ſo, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth them to do ſo: our Saviors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is a yoke of obedience unto us; ſeeing he commanded it, we muſt doe it; and therefore it is cleare in regard of Chriſt his commandement, and his practiſe, that it is ſo to be adminiſtred in both kindes, in the bread, and in the wine both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Papiſts that are the maine profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed adverſaries of God and of his truth in this caſe, they ſeeke out many ſhifts to avoid the force of this argument: All that they ſay may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe three heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſay they, you alleage the example of Chriſt, that holds in regard of the bread, but not in regard of the cup.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if it doe hold for the cup, yet it is to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16098:157"/>be adminiſtred only to the Clergy, and not to the ordinary people.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if to the lay people, yet it is a matter arbitrary to us of the Miniſtery, or to the Church; we may doe it if we will, but there is no neceſſity in it that we muſt do it. Theſe are their exceptions that they take: Firſt, it holds, ſay they, for the bread, but not for the cup, &amp;. if ſo be we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the inſtitution of our Saviour rightly, it will cleare all theſe miſts.</p>
            <p>For the firſt exception in particular: it holds ſay they, for the bread, but not for the cup. No? why Chriſt adminiſtred the bread and the cup, without any ſuch difference at all; without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring any of them one before the other: If the commandement and example of Chriſt binde to the one, why not to the other? Chriſt adminiſtred and commanded both, and yet they will not have both. If our Saviour had made any exception of the cup, it had beene another matter; but Chriſt adminiſtred it in both kindes, as well the wine as the bread, and therefore it holds in the one as wel as in the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the ſecond exception. Put the caſe it holds for the bread, and not for the cup too, yet it holds not, ſay they, that it ſhould bee adminiſtred to the laytie, and common people, onely to the Miniſters and Cleargy men. I, but our Saviour delivered indifferently to all that were preſent, the verie cup as well as the bread, and ſpeakes more of the cup than hee doth of the bread; for he ſaith not, eate ye all of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16098:158"/>this bread, though no doubt but that was his meaning; but comming to the cup he ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Drinke yee all of this;</hi> whoſoever comes to the Sacrament ſee he doe that.</p>
            <p>But the Papiſts take exception againſt this, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> that is they ſay, only the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Apoſtles, and men of the Clergie; that hee meant, for they only were then preſent, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it holds for the Clergy, and not for the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This is a very ſilly ſhift.</p>
            <p>But to anſwer this, firſt, howſoever it be indeed that there was none preſent but Miniſters; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ask the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this queſtion, If there had bin any there preſent that had not bin of the Miniſtry, can any man thinke that our Saviour would have turned away the cup from him, and not have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the wine, and ſo have turned them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? It were a graceleſſe, and ſenſeleſſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: certainly he would have beene as ready to have adminiſtred the cup to them, as the bread. Againe, theſe Apoſtles, howſoever they were of the Miniſterie, yet they were but receivers then, they were not Miniſters in that caſe. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if we have ſome two or three Miniſters at our Communion that are receivers, beſides him that delivers it, though they be Miniſters by Calling, yet there is no difference in this action betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and other receivers: So likewiſe the Apoſtles, though they were Miniſters, yet being then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, not then to adminiſter it, but to receive it adminiſtred by the hand of our Saviour Chriſt; therefore they differed nothing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16098:158"/>from ordinary people in that caſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, if ſo be that it be ſo, that this rule doth not hold for the cup as well as for the bread, that it ſhould not be given to the Laytie: I would fain know of any Papiſt in the world, what warrant he hath for the bread, that the bread ſhould be given to the Laytie? Surely nothing from our Saviours inſtitution, for they were onely Miniſters alſo, to whom hee delivered the bread, as well as the cup.</p>
            <p>Thirdly for the third exception, that though it doe extend the cup to the Laytie, yet it proves not that the ordinary people muſt have the cup of neceſſity. Why not of neceſſity? I would faine know, is there any neceſſitie by the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and commandement of Chriſt, that the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould have the bread co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to them? then there is as much neceſſitie for the other; for our Saviours practice is the ſame, his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſame, as well for the one, as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The commandement, the practice, &amp; inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour is the ſame, and therefore there is the ſame neceſſity; if it be of neceſſitie they ſhould have the bread, then it is of neceſſitie they ſhould have the wine too. If <hi>Paul</hi> may be taken to be the Iudge of this controverſie betweene them and us, and to be the interpreter of our Saviours meaning, then he will make the matter cleare on our fide.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whereas they ſay it is true, it holds for the bread, and not for the cup, you ſee the Apoſtle joynes them both together in theſe verſes, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16098:159"/>beſides that in the 24. verſe, <hi>When he had given thankes he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eate, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> and after the ſame manner in the 25. verſe, <hi>He tooke the Cup, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament of my blood:</hi> hee made no difference betweene them, but after the ſame manner, ſaith the Text, that he did inſtitute, take, and deliver the one, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner hee did the other, and ſo ought we: If it hold for the bread, then ſurely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner it holds for the wine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſay they, it holds not for the Laitie, but onely for the Clergie: But the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>As oft as yee eate this bread, and drinke this cup,</hi> that is ſpoken to the Church, not to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters onely, but to all the people. And verſe 28. <hi>Let a man therefore examine himſelfe,</hi> which is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule for all receivers of this Sacrament, of what ſtate or calling ſoever they be.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, put the caſe it be ſo, that the Laitie may have the cup, yet (ſay they) there is no ſuch neceſſitie that it muſt be ſo: But the Apoſtle gives us a cleare rule for that in the 23. verſe, where hee ſaith, <hi>I have received of the Lord, that which I alſo have delivered unto you.</hi> That all the rules that the Apoſtle gives to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacraments, might be underſtood to be of a commanding power to binde their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hee commends them as Gods owne ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So then, that which he received of Chriſt, he delivered unto them; That which he delivers unto them, is the ordinance of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. but hee delivers it to then, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16098:159"/>people ſhould drinke the cup, as well as eate the bread, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. Therefore this is the very ordinance of Chriſt himſelfe, and therefore of abſolute neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>It is worth our obſervation here, that the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> did ſpeake nothing of our Sauiours command, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> hee ſpeakes it onely concerning the bread: But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> a faithfull Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Chriſt, ſpeakes it not onely of the bread, but of the cup too, verſe 24. <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, which is broken for you, This doe in remembrance of mee:</hi> So the very ſame commandement he doth uſe concerning the cup, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. The ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that is for the bread, the ſame he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for the cup, and therefore the ſame necesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that there is for the one to be adminiſtred to the Laitie, the ſame there is for the other.</p>

The body and blood of Chriſt. What is the ſigne? Bread and wine. Chriſt gave his body to be crucified, &amp; his blood to be ſhed, and therefore both theſe are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Sacrament: and therefore they muſt have the wine adminiſtred as well as the bread. Wee are ſaved by the blood of Chriſt, as well as by the body of Chriſt: there muſt be a due proportion betweene the ſigne and the thing ſignified.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Againe, it may appeare by the nature of a feaſt, ſpecially of Gods feaſts. In a feaſt there muſt be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16098:160"/>ſome drinke, as well as bread, elſe it is but a dry feaſt, as wee ſay, if there be no drinke: and many a poore and dry feaſt have the people amongſt the Papiſts, who onely have bread at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not a drop of drink with it: but the Lord hath beene more mercifull and bountifull to us then ſo: he makes us a feaſt at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Is it againſt the nature of a feaſt, to have bread onely, and not wine? Doth not the neceſſitie of a feaſt require that they ſhould have both? Then the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, being the Lords feaſt, muſt bee furniſhed with the cup as well as with the bread.</p>
            <p>So in regard of our diſpoſition, and of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, every one of us that know how ſweet the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is, cannot but both hunger and thirſt after him. Whoſoever reliſheth the body of Chriſt, will hunger after the body of Chriſt: and whoſoever reliſheth the blood of Chriſt, will thirſt after the blood of Chriſt. And our Saviour doth propound himſelfe unto us, that hee is not onely bread to ſatisfie our hunger, but water of life alſo to ſatisfie our thirſt: this is Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of himſelfe, as hee is our Redeemer and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, wee come to the Sacrament, there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt, to worſhip Chriſt, to apprehend him, and to receive him, as our Mediator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: and therefore the Sacrament muſt not onely afford us bread to ſatisfie our hunger, but wine alſo to ſatisfie our thirſt.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> The <hi>Vſe.</hi> Firſt it ſerves to reprove them in the Popiſh Church, that deprive the ordinary people
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16098:160"/>of the cup. It is a great ſinne in them, for they make themſelves in that caſe wiſer then the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, changing his ordinance at their own pleaſure. They ſay, they muſt not have the cup for feare of ſhedding his blood. Curſed hypocrites! that make themſelves more jealous of ſhedding the blood of Chriſt, than Chriſt himſelfe did. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they doe maime the Sacrament, and make it imperfect, in that they do take away one materiall part of the Sacrament, ſo alſo they doe exceedingly wrong the people in that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of the benefit and comfort that they might have by the blood of Chriſt; as much as in them lyeth, they deprive and defraud them of it. If we being at the Sacrament, there ſhould come in a mad man, and ſteale away the cup from us, would we not ſay that he is a ſacrilegious theeſe, and ſpoiles Gods ordinances, &amp; robs the Church? So, doe not they maime the Sacrament, &amp; wrong and rob the people in the church of Rome of that which is their due by Gods ordinance, by keeping backe the cup? But they have a diſtinction, they have a ſhift and device that they thinke will ſalve all.</p>
            <p>The Body ſay they, doth containe the blood too, they have the blood in the body; for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy containes his blood by way of concomitancie. But this is a very ſory ſhift, quite contrary to the practice of our Saviour, and contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament. Wee come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, to celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of his body by it ſelfe, and to celebrate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16098:161"/>the memoriall of Chriſts ſhedding of his blood by it ſelfe. And Chriſt inſtituted that Sacrament of purpoſe not onely to remember the death of Chriſt in the bread, but Chriſt commended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto us in the Sacrament, as his body being ſevered from his blood, and his blood being out of his body, ſo his body to be a ſacrifice, and his blood to be a ſacrifice, and ſo hath appointed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſignes anſwerable to each of them. And this meets directly with this fooliſh conceit of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. We receive the body of Chriſt as a ſevered thing from his blood, for they were then ſevered the one from the other.</p>
            <p>Againe, the next <hi>Vſe.</hi> It ſhould put us in minde of the love of God towards us, in delivering and bringing us out of the hands of theſe robbers, that have made a prey of the Church of God, and doe make a prey of it, keeping backe the people from receiving that part of the Sacrament. This ſhould teach us alſo to magnifie the bountifull goodnes of God to us, that bidding us to his table, he doth not ſcantle us to a morſell of dry bread, but with the bread he gives us wine; He reacheth forth the cup to us, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, Here, here, thou poore hungry and thirſty ſoule, take wine to thy bread, and eate and drinke, and be mery, and take thy fill upon thy Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, and cheare up thy heart in feeding upon whole Chriſt for thy comfort, and life, and ſalvation, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22.26. <hi>The poore ſhall eate and be ſatisfied, and their hearts ſhall live for ever.</hi> It is ſpoken generally to all the Saints of <hi>God</hi> that beleeve in him. It is performed &amp; made good
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16098:161"/>in this parcicular. God gives us to eate to the ful at his table, whereby wee may be fully ſatisfied, that our hearts may live for ever. <hi>Pro.</hi> 9. It is the voyce of the Word, which ſaith, <hi>Come and eate of my meat, and drinke of my wine.</hi> Chriſt he is the true <hi>Wiſedome</hi> there ſpoken of. It is he that calls us to eate and to drinke of his meat and his wine. And this is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled in the act of receiving the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider this with thankful harts, conſider the fatherly care of God toward us, that meets us at it were at every turne. He gives us the bread to ſignifie Chriſt his body broken for us; &amp; the wine to ſignifie the ſhedding of his blood for us. Is any of us diſtruſtfull that Chriſts body is not enough for us? here is his blood too. Have we taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the bread, and of the body of Chriſt, &amp; found little or no reliſh in it? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Miniſter comes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to give us the wine, that by the preſence of the wine he may quicken us to the better ſenſe of the bread.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, doe wee finde joy and comfort in the bread? bleſſe God for it. But thats not al; ſeeing we find this comfort in the bread, he gives us the wine too, that ſo our joy may be full in every reſpect to our harts deſire. This is the bountifull goodnes of Chriſt Ieſus, that hath given his body to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon the Croſſe, and his blood to be ſhed for our ſins; That he hath given us his whole body, his body &amp; blood, that ſo there may be nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to give us full contentment and ſatisfaction, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is an all-ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and a plenteous Redeemer.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT wee may be prepared to the worthy participation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, wee are now to meditate upon ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fitting for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and to proceed in that Text we beganne in, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as oft as you ſhall eate this bread and drinke this cup, you ſhew the Lords death till hee come.</hi> The Text, you may remember, we divided into two parts. Firſt, here is an action to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in the former part of the verſe, The recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Lords Supper. Secondly, here is a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that this action is to be performed withall, and that is in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>yee ſhew
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16098:163"/>the Lords death till he come.</hi> Concerning the action in the former part of the verſe, we noted two things: Firſt, the parts of the action, to eate <hi>this bread, and drinke this cup.</hi> Secondly, the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the action in this clauſe, <hi>As oft as you eate this bread, and drinke this cup, &amp;c.</hi> It is to be done, and it is to be frequented or done often. Of the parts of this action, we have ſpoken before; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we noted, firſt, that the nature and benefit of the Sacrament conſiſteth in the uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Apoſtle deſcribes the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the uſe of it. Secondly, wee noted that the bread and wine, the elements that are uſed in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their owne name after the words of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and therefore for ſubſtance they are the ſame creatures as before. Thirdly, they are (as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſet forth by a note of excellency, <hi>this bread,</hi> and <hi>this wine;</hi> though in regard of their nature they are the ſame, yet in regard of their uſe they are more excellent than any other. Laſtly, he couples them together; <hi>As oft as you ſhall eat this bread, and drinke this cup:</hi> thence wee noted, that the Sacrament is not to be adminiſtred in one kinde onely, but in both, in the bread, and in the wine, and not in the bread without the wine, nor in wine; without the bread. And ſo much of the parts of this action. The other branch follows, namely, the frequenting or often performance of the action, in theſe words, <hi>As oft as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup:</hi> whereby is given us to underſtand, that as this action of receiving the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16098:163"/>Sacrament of the Lords Supper is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo it is to be frequented and oft performed: we muſt eate this bread, and drinke this cup, and that oft-times.</p>
            <p>It may appeare by the circumſtances of the Text, that this Church of Corinth to whom the Apoſtle writ this Epiſtle, that they did uſually in moſt of their Church-aſſemblies and meetings, (if not in all) communicate in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: for the Apoſtle in the 17. and 18. verſes tells them of things generally amiſſe in the Church: and in the 20. verſe he gives inſtance in this particular, namely, in the matter of the Lords Supper: Marke the words; <hi>When yee come together therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper.</hi> The words doe ſound to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that uſually when the Corinthians came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Church-aſſemblies, they did eat the Lords Supper, howſoever they did much miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane and miſcarie themſelves in this holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they did not carry themſelves ſo to Gods glory, norwith reverence to his ordinance, nor with that profit and comfort to themſelves, and love to their brethren as they ought to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received it diſorderly one before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet notwithſtanding for the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that was uſuall amongſt them: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tooke this for a thing granted, that when they came together they did eate: elſe the conſequence had beene to no purpoſe: but ſpeaking generally of their aſſemblies &amp; Church-meetings, he ſpeaks of the eating of the Sacrament, as a thing uſuall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16098:164"/>in moſt of them, if not in all: and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Apoſtle falls into the mention of the frequenting of this action; <hi>As oft as you eate this bread, and drinke this cup, &amp;c.</hi> which yet we muſt take heed that we underſtand it not onely as a bare mention of a thing done by the Church of Corinth, that they did eate and drinke oft: as if he ſhould ſay, They did ſo indeed, but whether it were well done or ill done it makes no matter; the circumſtances of the Text give us better light to ſee by for our reſolution herein; and we may therein diſcerne theſe three things: Firſt, that it was not a thing amiſſe that they did ſo; yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it was well done; yea thirdly, that it is a duty of neceſſity, for them and all the faithfull to communicate in.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it was not a thing amiſſe among them, for if it had, certainly the Apoſtle would have reproved them for it, as he did for other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, eſpecially ſeeing he tooke upon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and reforme ſuch abuſes as were crept into the matter of the Sacrament; they doing this, and oft frequenting the participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, if ſo be that it had beene a thing amiſſe, (the Apoſtle of purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving things amiſſe) he would have reproved this, but ſeeing he reproved it not, therefore it was not ill done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Text makes it cleare that it was well done, and it is ſpoken by way of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Apoſtle builds a precept upon this practice of theirs; <hi>So oft as you eate this bread, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16098:164"/>drinke this cup, you ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> The precept is, they muſt <hi>ſhew the Lords death:</hi> and that precept is built upon this their practice, their oft receiving of the Sacrament; and this is a generall rule, that God never builds any precept but upon a good ground &amp; foundation, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation muſt be his owne, as well as the building, elſe he never builds upon it: but the Lord builds a precept upon this practice, and therefore their practice is good, and indeed a matter that God approves of; ſo that you ſee that the Text makes it cleare that it is a commendable thing; and if we ſhould goe further to ſpeake of the laſt clauſe of the verſe, <hi>Doe it till he come,</hi> that alſo ſhewes that it is a matter commendable, becauſe it muſt continue to be done to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is a matter of neceſſity that they muſt doe it, it is an admonition to a neceſſary duty: for the riſe of this ſpeech of the Apoſtle, is fetcht from our Saviours owne words in the inſtitution, verſe 25. now that is ſpoken by way of command, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> Marke it, here you ſee that our Saviour plainly doth deliver this by way of a command unto them, <hi>Doe this as oft as you doe it in remembrance of me:</hi> he delivers it, I ſay, in the nature of a commandement, as alſo by and by we ſhall ſhew more plainly. Now if ſo be that Chriſt commanded it, therefore it muſt needs be done, and it is a matter of neceſſity: the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God are not arbitrary to us, to doe them or not to doe them, but every Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imports a neceſſity, that therefore it muſt be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16098:165"/>done, becauſe it is commanded: And where it is ſaid, <hi>You ſhew forth the Lords death, &amp;c.</hi> that clauſe ſhewes that it is not once to be done, that will not ſerve the turne, but oft; the continuall repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of it is neceſſary from time to time, even to the worlds end. So then this is the thing that here we are co ſeize upon, that the frequent receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and continuall uſe.</p>

               </label> The obſervation is this: That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is an ordinary exerciſe of Chriſtians, oft-times to be frequented and uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be communicated in by the faithful. The circumſtances of the text well waighed &amp; laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, afford this doctrine clearly: for the proofe of this doctrine take the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Chriſt, and the practice of the Church: the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Saviour Chriſt enjoines this frequent uſe of the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and of the receiving of it: <hi>Luke</hi> 22 19. <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) which words of our Saviour, <hi>Paul</hi> in the 25. verſe of this Chapter rehearſeth thus; <hi>Doe this as oft as you drinke it, in remembrance of me. Paul</hi> knew well the meaning of our Saviour, therefore he ſets it downe in theſe plaine termes. So then when our Saviour faith, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> theſe words of his they cary in them the force of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble charge or command: Firſt, of a thing antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or going before, that is, the receiving of the Sacrament: and ſecondly, of a thing conſequent, that this is to be done in remembrance of me, ſee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16098:165"/>you remember me alwayes in the performance of this worke; the Apoſtle adding this clauſe by way of explication, <hi>Doe this as oft as you doe it, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me;</hi> he makes it cleare, that ſurely each of theſe are to be performed, and that oft: <hi>Doe this;</hi> that is, receive the Sacrament oft: <hi>remember me,</hi> that is, remember mee oft : by this clauſe Chriſt ſhewes his meaning, that both of them is to be done oft; the Sacrament oft to be received, and the death of Chriſt oft to bee remembred; and ſurely the neceſſity of the conſequent doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the neceſſity of the antecedent: the neceſſity of the often remembrance of Chriſt, inferres the neceſſity of the often receiving the Sacrament, becauſe the Sacrament is ordained for the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of Chriſt: if we muſt remember Chriſt oft, and that in the Sacrament, then we muſt receive the Sacrament oft.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe words of our Saviour as they bee applyed in that caſe to the Diſciples, though they are in effect the ſame with theſe words of my Text, yet they are a more cleare and a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionleſſe proofe of this doctrine than my text is: for ſome cavill at the words of my Text, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them not ſufficient to prove that the frequent uſe of the Sacrament is neceſſary for Chriſtians; for the Apoſtle, ſay they, doth but mention it as a thing done; or if he doe commend it, that is all, it proves not the neceſſity of it: the Apoſtle ſaith not, that they muſt doe it, but ſpeakes of it as a thing already done by them. Well, put caſe it be ſo here; but when Chriſt ſpake to his Diſciples
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16098:166"/>he ſaid to them, <hi>Doe this as oft as you doe it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me:</hi> now they had never eaten of this bread, nor dranke of this cup before, and therefore it could not be ſpoken as of a thing u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually done by them: therefore our Saviours words cannot be ſo eluded, as they would elude the words of my Text. Now ſeeing <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech and our Saviours goe together, as both contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one and the ſame thing, therfore when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> and when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>As oft as you doe this, you ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> both theſe teſtimonies prove this, namely, that it is a matter of neceſſity that the death of Chriſt is oft to be remembred, and that the Sacrament is oft to be received. And ſurely in all ordinary underſtanding, this clauſe here, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As oft, &amp;c.</hi> muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply a neceſſity of eating it oft: as if ſo be this, I ſhould ſay to a Chriſtian friend, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pray, pray for me; or, as oft as you pray pray for me; if I ſhould thinke that ſuch a one would pray but once in his life time, or but very ſeldome, then I would not ſay, As oft as you pray pray for me; but, If ever you do pray, pray for me: So if the Apoſtle had had an intent to give liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them to receive it oft if they would, or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome if they would not, then he would have ſaid, If ever you receive it, then doe it in remembrance of Chriſt: but in faying, <hi>As oft as you doe this,</hi> that ſhewes it is a matter of neceſſity; there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity implyed as well in the oft receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erament, as well as a neceſſity of the oft remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16098:166"/>bring of the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The other proofe is the practice of the Church, (which ratifies and continues this,) beſides the practice of this Church of Corinth, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. there <hi>Paul</hi> and other of the Diſciples being at <hi>Troas,</hi> going to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the text ſaith, verſ. 7. <hi>They being come together to breake bread the firſt day of the weeke, Paul preached unto them: The firſt day of the weeke;</hi> what is that? that is the Sabbath day, the Lords day: What is <hi>the breaking of bread?</hi> what is meant by that? why, the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: <hi>The Diſciples being come together,</hi> that is to ſay, after their uſuall manner, <hi>the firſt day of the weeke to breake bread, Paul preached unto them.</hi> The manner of ſpeech declares that it was their practice, their uſual and ordinary practice at their comming together in their Chriſtian aſſemblies, to communicate in breaking of bread. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be ſo alſo by other circumſtances there mentioned, as namely, the company, many Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, verſe 4.5. being then in a ſtrange place, at <hi>Troas,</hi> and in their journey travelling by the way. If they did it abroad when they were travelling, then much more would they doe it when they were at home, and at reſt; and therefore theſe circumſtances of the Text make it cleare that it was an uſuall practice of the Church ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. there it is ſaid of them that were converted, <hi>that they continued together in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayers:</hi> by breaking of bread we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16098:167"/>the participation in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: <hi>They continued in breaking bread;</hi> Marke what the Text ſaith, they continued in it, not once or twice, but they continued in it, they made it their daily and continuall practice.</p>
            <p>And ſee with what holy exerciſes it is ranged withall, <hi>They continued together in the Apoſtles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and fellowſhip, breaking of bread, and prayers:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, it was as uſuall and familiar with them to receive the Sacrament, as to heare the word, and to meet together in prayer; and the ranging of this duty amongſt other holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes ſeemes to give ſome ſecret intimation of a reaſon why they made this their ordinary and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall practice; becauſe when theſe duties are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed together, they are marvellous helpfull one to another, one ſeconds and backs another: they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, in fellowſhip, love-meetings, breaking of bread, and prayer. If we ſhould looke into the ſtate of the Church in ſucceeding ages, we ſhall finde by ſtories, that ſtill the nearer the Church lived to the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the more frequent and more uſuall was their practice in the receiving of this Sacrament often: in ſo much that in ſome places it was every Sabbath, in others at leaſt every moneth: the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine then is cleare, both by the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, and alſo by the practice of the Church.</p>

That the death of Chriſt is oft to be remembred, I hope no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will deny, the death of Chriſt, a matter ſo weighty in it ſelfe, the greateſt buſineſſe that ever was acted ſince the world ſtood, the death of Chriſt being a matter of ſo great conſequence to Mankinde, that every man and woman ſo farre forth is ſaved or damned, as they have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or have not their portion in the death of Chriſt; the death of Chriſt being ſo comfortable to the faithfull, that it is the very life of all the good that they have here, or ſhall have hereafter, and can we ever remember this oft enough? and can we omit any occaſion of the remembring of Chriſt his death, without ſin, and without much diſhonour to God, much wrong and indignity to Chriſt, and damage to our owne ſoules? ſturely we cannot. I, but ſome me wil ſay, I can remember the death of Chriſt, though not by receiving the Sacrament; I can remember it in the word, for there Chriſt is crucified before me, and in my prayers, and in all my good and holy meditations, and in other things as well as in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. It is true thou maiſt, and it is true thou muſt, yet notwithſtanding wee muſt conceive that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is inſtituted of purpoſe for this meere end, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the death of Chriſt; and therefore if thou canſt meditate profitably upon the death of Chriſt in other exerciſes, then much more thou

Beſides that, in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper there is a moſt ſenſible occaſion offered unto us, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the death of Chriſt; the death of Chriſt is as it were acted before our eyes, by the breaking of the bread, and the pouring out of the wine, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may fitly, and muſt of neceſſity bee ſtirred up to remember with our ſelves, how freely the Lord Ieſus Chriſt gave his body to be crucified, and his blood to be ſhed for the taking away of our ſinnes. If therefore the death of Chriſ muſt be remembred, then the Sacrament wherein wee behold the death of Chriſt as in a glaſſe, muſt needs be oft received and participated in.</p>

That the Word is oft to bee heard, I thinke none will deny that; wee muſt heare the Word at all times, by day and by night, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, the Word and the Sacraments are joyned together in a neare bond and league by Gods ordinance, and they are to one and the ſame purpoſe and efrect as a writing and a ſeale, and therefore if we muſt be frequent in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, then alſo frequent in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that ſo that which is ſpoken in the Word, may be ſealed unto us in the Sacrament; that that wee heare in the one, we may feele in the other, that ſo we may grow along in the faith of Chriſt, till at length we become perfect men in Chriſt.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> The firſt Vſe is for matter of reproofe of groſſe and grievous negligence in the practice of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty generally, and the negligence ſeizeth upon the Miniſters many times, as well as upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Firſt, we will ſpeake againſt the negligence of the Miniſters, and then of the negligence of the people. A word or two of the firſt.</p>
            <p>Many Miniſers are negligent in this duty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forſooth, becauſe they would ſpare their owne paines and labour, or elfe becauſe they are careleſſe of the flocke of Chriſt committed unto
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16098:171"/>them, they have not that regard of them as they ſhould: hence it comes to paſſe that they let the people ſettle themſelves upon the lees of their ſins: either they tender it not oft unto them, but haply once, or foure times a yeare; or if they doe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it often, yet they ſuffer the people to abſent themſelves without any juſt occaſion: great is the negligence of many in this caſe; and ſurely it is a fearfull ſinne, and a heavie account have many to make for this ſinne. It is our duty (that are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters) to ſpread the table before you, and to call, warne, and invite you to come, and to ſeeke this to the utmoſt of our power, and then if you come not oft, you ſhal periſh in your ſins &amp; negligence, but we ſhall deliver our owne ſoules: but if wee be negligent in this, and doe not call upon you oft, you ſhall periſh in your ſins, and your blood ſhall be required at our hands; and therefore it ſtands us upon to looke unto it, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our owne ſoules, and our owne good, but in regard of you, and in love to your ſoules, that wee ſhould tender you the Lords Supper oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and call upon you oft to come unto it: how many good and holy opportunities have we offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us to remember the death of Chriſt? to confirm and ſtrengthen the faith of them that are weake, and to cheriſh love in the hearts of Gods children, and to encreaſe in them the grace of ſanctification, by the often uſe of this Sacrament? How many good opportunities are daily omitted and neglected in this land, and in this City, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Miniſters negligence in this duty?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16098:172"/>many ſoules there bee that periſh becauſe of this negligence in Miniſters, and therefore it is our duty to bee ſtirred up, and to labour to reforme our ſelves. The Apoſtle gives us the rule, when he ſaith, Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt not thou thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But in the ſecond place, the negligence of the people is more convenient for this place to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved thereby: when the Table is ſpred, when God ſaith to them, Come, when the Miniſter ſaith All is ready, and their brethren ſay, Come, too; when they are thus warned, called, and invited to come, and then they refuſe, or if they doe come it is very ſparingly, it is not oft; this is a moſt graceleſſe and retchleſſe practice. If wee were ſcantled of this great meanes and bleſſing either by perſecutton, or by the iniquity of the times, or by the prophaneneſſe of the Magiſtrate, or by the graceleſſeneſſe of the Miniſter, then wee would cry out, we cannot have that we would have, and that we are wronged, and debarred of the ſaving ordinance of God, and that the doore of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is ſhut againſt us, and that wee cannot partake ſo oft as wee would. But now that through Gods mercy, wee have the Sacrament oft tendered unto us, and that we are called, and warned, and invited to communicate, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe now to come, or if wee come ſparingly, what is this, but to deſpiſe the bountifull, and rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God towards us, that the Lord offereth us ſo many heavenly excellencies and comforts with one hand; for in this one action is Chriſt Ieſus &amp;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16098:172"/>all his merits offered to us: what is this but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe God that offereth ſo many bleſſings of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comfort, Chriſt Ieſus, and all his merits, and we turne our backes upon him, and ſay we wil none of this heavenly <hi>Manna.</hi> And ſurely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this be reformed, it cannot but be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of God, with extremity of Iuſtice in ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious judgement upon us, ſpecially by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuch rich and precious treaſures from ſuch baſe wretches as we are, that ſo meanly eſteeme of them; or elſe that God ſhould cry quittance with us, and turne his backe upon us when wee pray (as wee have turned our backes upon him when he called) and will not heare us. As alſo when we are ſicke, and when wee lye upon our death beds God will not regard us, goe whither we will; and at the day of Iudgement, he ſhall ſay <hi>Depart from meye curſed, I know you not,</hi> I offered you ſuch and ſuch meanes of ſalvation, and that oftentimes, but you would none of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have no ſalvation for you. We know how God dealt with the <hi>Iewes</hi> when the myſteries of ſalvation were tendered unto them, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the ſame, he then turned to the Gentiles, to them that would bring forth better fruit: when thoſe that were bidden to the Feaſt would not come, the Lord ſaid, <hi>goe into the high wayes, and as many as ye find, bid them, &amp;c.</hi> A notable example we have in the firſt of <hi>Heſter,</hi> and 3. <hi>Abaſhueroſh</hi> the King made a great Feaſt, and he bade his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the Queene <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> and in the 12, verſe ſhe refuſed to come to the King, and therefore in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16098:173"/>the 19, verſe ſhe is divorced, ſhe ſhall never come more into the Kings preſence: ſhall wee thinke that he tendered his temporall glory, more then God doth his infinite glory: if God tender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his feaſt, and ſpread his table, and call us as the King called her to eate and to drinke of that which he hath prepared, if wee refuſe to come as ſhe did, what can we expect, but that there ſhall be a divorce made betweene God and us, <hi>I will not acknowledge you for my ſpouſe,</hi> (will God ſay) <hi>you ſhall have no more my ordinances nor Oracles amongst you.</hi> Let us I beſeech you rightly conſider of theſe things, and ſo farre as we are guilty, labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them in our ſelves, and according to our power in others. It is ſtrange to ſee, and to heare what, ſtrange alligations men make to colour themſelves in this their negligence, it is ſtrange to ſee how witty men are to colour theſe things, and to deceive their owne ſoules, it is the Devills wit, he puts it into them: now the true ground and reaſon why they come not oft to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, becauſe they contemne Gods ordinance, and are unthankfull to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt for his infinite love; and withall alſo it is a kinde of ſluggiſhneſſe that is in them, that they are loth to put themſelves and their hearts to ſuch examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tryalls, and provings, and ſiftings, and rippings up; to ſuch denying of themſelves, and ſuch faithfull promiſes to God of new obedience, as every one that comes as a worthy receiver muſt have, they are loth to put themſelves to this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; therfore they communicate not oft in this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16098:173"/>Sacrament, and this is the true reaſon why they are loth to come to it, they ſay it is a toyl to come ſo oft: it is true, it is a toyle to the fleſh, and to corrupt nature, but no toyle to a childe of God, but joy and comfort to him.</p>
            <p>Yet further you ſhall heare what they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge and pretend beſides, ſome of them ſay there is no ſuch neceſſity that we ſhould receive it ſo oft, and they give you ſome reaſons for it; as firſt, why ſay they? the Sacrament of Baptiſme is a Sacrament of good uſe as well as the ſacrament of the Lords Supper, and that is to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in but once, and why then ſhould wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſo oft in the ſacrament of the Lords Supper?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, baptiſme is ordained for our admiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the Church and houſe of God, and there can be but one admiſſion into if; but when wee are in, then we muſt grow further and further to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into Chriſt, and that is by the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper: our baptiſme gives us our admiſſion and entrance, though the power of baptiſme continues to our lives end, and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feeles not the power of his baptiſme in the courſe of his life, that man was never truly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: though the outward action of baptiſme bee not to be reiterated, yet ſtill it continues in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our laſt end, ſtill we are baptized into the death of Chriſt, ſtill wee muſt labour to bee that which we are baptized to be, to be like to Chriſt, and to follow him. So then you ſee there is great reaſon why baptiſm muſt be but once becauſe that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16098:174"/>is the admiſſion of us into the Church, but this is our going forward in the Church, and in the work of grace; therefore we muſt not ſtand ſtill, but proceed forward in this exerciſe continually.</p>
            <p>Againe, another reaſon that they alleadge is this, I but, ſay they, was not the Paſſeover in the former Teſtament a ſacrifice anſwerable to the Sacrament in the new Teſtament, and that was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated but once a yeare, and why then ſhould this be often?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, there is great reaſon; the time of the celebration of the Paſſeover was a ceremony, and ſo a part of Gods worſhip to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was commanded to be celebrated once, and but once in the year, and they ſhould have ſinned if they had celebrated it more then once, but the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is to bee celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted often, and we ſinne if wee doe not. Beſides that, the Paſſeover was but for one temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and from the hand of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and that one deliverance was but once wrought; but the Sacrament of the Lords Supper reſembles unto us our eternal deliverance from ſinne, Sathan, hell, death, and damnation; and this is not onely wrought but dayly running on, and all Converts are ſtill dayly plucked out from hell, and the jawes of Sathan. The worke of our redemption is every day after that wee are throughly converted; ſtill the old man is crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the new man is repaired in us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howſoever it were ſufficient that the paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was once celebrated, and but once; yet this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16098:174"/>crament of the Lords Supper is oft to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe it is the celebration of our eternall and everlaſting redemption and deliverance, a thing that is continually in working.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if ſo be that that were a good rule, then it followes, that as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to celebrate the Paſſeover that day onely that they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then it followes, that wee ſhould receive this Sacrament, but onely upon good Fryday, and no time elſe, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſe, that that is Iewiſh; and therefore by their owne confeſſion, this can bee no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the often participation of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon that they have, that there is no neceſſity in receiving it oft, is the example of our Saviour Chriſt; we need not to bee more carefull ſay they, then Chriſt, and he never received it but once in all his life time, and therefore wee need have it but once. I anſwer, Chriſt to the time of his death was under the Law as hee was man, and ſo was to behave himſelfe and conforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ceremonies of the Law, and therefore he was not to have a hand in this Sacrament of the new Teſtament, till the time came that the old was to be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, we muſt underſtand that hee was rather an Inſtitutor then a receiver of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therfore he was to make choyce of the fitteſt time when it was to be done, and that was as neere to his death as could be, and therefore he ſpake of it as a thing paſt, <hi>This is my blood that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16098:175"/>is ſhed for you:</hi> ſo that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt be as neere to his death as may bee, and therefore it was fitteſt to bee inſtituted by him the night before he ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, if they ſay ſo, then they muſt conclude by their owne rule, that they muſt never receive the ſacrament, but when they are ready to dye, if that reaſon hold good; But as I ſaid before, our Saviour Chriſt was the Inſtitutor of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; therfore he choſe that time that it might bee the freſher in memory. Another thing they alledge, is a matter of inconveniency: oh ſay they, if we ſhould come oft, it would be tedious to us. I ſurely, matters of God are tedious to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnall men, tedious to fleſh and blood, to put it ſelfe to ſuch examination and tryall, to ſuch ſifting, and ranſacking, and rippings up, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves, this is tedious; but muſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to come to the ſacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this tediouſneſſe? No ſurely, the old man muſt be trodden down under our feet, &amp; ſcorned, that God may have the honour of his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: many mayſay ſo, for hearing of the Word, that it is a tedious thing to heare twice a day, ſo alſo for prayer, it is a tedious thing to pray twice day, morning and evening, ſo faith the Devill ſo ſaith the old man, and the naturall corruption that is within us, but muſt ſwallow downe all his hardneſſe, and the old man muſt be crucified and mortified, if ever wee looke to bee ſaved, and to come to heaven; we muſt diſpence with, and wee muſt devoure many of thoſe tediouſneſſes; if ever
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16098:175"/>we looke to have any portion in Chriſt, tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt not fright us from that which God commands, but if God command, we muſt obey, whatſoever fleſh and blood alledge to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Againe, another exception is this, if we come oft, ſay they, we ſhall degenerate into a kinde of formality, and make it a matter of faſhion. I, that comes from the carnality and hypocriſie of thy heart; we cannot be converſant in any holy duty, but in time we ſettle upon our lees, and grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kinde of formality: alas, if we did conſider our ſelves, wee had need to be ript up daily, and if we ſhould put our ſelves daily to this duty, we ſhould be freer from this formality than thoſe that uſe it ſo ſeldome. Is this it that makes us doe it formally, becauſe we doe it oft? No ſurely. As in die matter of prayer, becauſe wee pray daily, doe we therefore pray formally? No. For if we doe it conſcionably it will make us farre from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, for the frequent uſe of it brings us into that awe, dread, and reverence of Gods Majeſtie that it will make us call our wits together, and ranſacke every corner of our hearts, that ſo wee may be fitted to come into the preſence of God at all times. Some other allegations they have, but I will not now ſtand upon them.</p>
            <p>The laſt Vſe is this: It teacheth all of us thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, that live here in this Land, and in this place, where through Gods mercy wee have opportunity, and may have acceſſe to come to this Sacrament at leaſt once a month to feaſt our
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16098:176"/>ſelves, and to make our ſelves merry with this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food, the body and blood of Chriſt, it is a thing that if we had it not we would give all wee have to enjoy it, and therefore having it let us make uſe of it, and reverently eſteeme of it, and neglect no good opportunity to come to it: if we knew the benefit of it wee would deſire to receive it not onely once a month, but every Sabbath, yea every day if it were poſſible: and the reaſon why we doe frequent it no oftner, not thirſt after it, is becauſe we know not the benefit nor ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it. Let us not lay any impediment to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from it, for none will ſerve the turne to be juſtifiable before God, but thoſe that God layes upon us; I ſay, we having juſt occaſion and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to come to the Lords Table, being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Congregation, without wee can give ſome good reaſon to the contrary, (for it is not enough to ſay I am not prepared, nor I am not in charity, theſe are no ſufficient nor juſt occaſions to hinder us) were to ſin grievouſly therein againſt God, and againſt our owne ſoules.</p>

            <head>THE SIXTEENTH LECTVRE VPON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORDS SVPPER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now to proceed through Gods aſſiſtance, (becauſe the next Sabbath is a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Sabbath) in that very buſineſs that we have in hand. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as you ſhall eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> You heard even now the diviſion of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into two parts: the former part ſhewes an action to bee performed, the receiving of the Lords Supper: the latter part preſcribes a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that this action is to be performed withall, You ſhew forth the Lords death: <hi>As oft as you eate this bread, and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> We have finiſhed the former part, that which is contained in the former words of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16098:177"/>the verſe, namely, the action here to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. We are now to proceed to handle the latter part, namely, the caution or the condition that this action is to be performed withall, <hi>Ye ſhew the Lords death, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein firſt we are to conſider the caution or the condition it ſelfe, that is, the ſhewing forth of the Lords death. Secondly, we are to conſider the frequenting, or the often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of this caution. For though it be not ſaid here, you often ſhew forth the Lord death, yet that is neceſſarily implyed: for the word <hi>(often)</hi> uſed in the beginning of the verſe, is common to the latter part of the verſe as well as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, As oft as you eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup, ſo oft you ſhew forth the Lords death. Then here is laſtly the continuance of it, how long this caution or conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be obſerved, ſurely ſo long as the world ſtands, till Chriſt come to judgment: <hi>As oft as you eate this bread and drinke this cup, you ſhew the Lords death, &amp;c.</hi> or ſhew ye the Lords death till he come. Firſt, to begin w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the caution or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, it ſelfe, <hi>you ſhew forth:</hi> wherein firſt conſider the matter that is to be remembred, it is the Lords death: Secondly, you muſt conſider the manner how it is to bee remembred, by a ſhewing of it forth, by a kinde of lively repreſenting and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, <hi>ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come:</hi> this is our remembring of Chriſt his death: for Chriſt ſaith in the former verſe, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in this verſe ſhewes how, that is, by <hi>ſhewing forth the Lords death till he come,</hi> or by a lively expreſſing of it.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:16098:177"/>
            <p>Firſt, therefore to begin with the matter that is to be remembred or ſhewed forth, and that is the Lords death. Wherein firſt when the Apoſtle here names death, wee are to underſtand hereby theſe two things: firſt, the act of death in reſpect of Chriſt himſelfe: ſecondly, the benefit of Chriſt his death in reſpect of us; we muſt remember the Lords death, that is, the act of his death in reſpect of himſelfe: we muſt remember and ſhew forth his ſufferings in his ſoule and in his body, his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, his obedience, his woundings, his nayling to the Croſſe, his ſhedding of his blood, his giving up the ghoſt. Secondly, withall we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the death of Chriſt, the benefit thereof ariſing unto us, the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, the ſatisfaction of our puniſhment, our reconciling unto God, the perfect and abſolute redemption of our ſoules and bodies from that miſerable and damnable eſtate that we were in; this is the death of Chriſt, and the right remembring of his death; remember Chriſt dying, the act of his death; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſt dying, the benefit of his death to us; and this is the right remembring of Chriſt his death which is tendred unto us in the Sacrament of the Lord ſupper. But yet withall when it is ſaid <hi>remember his death,</hi> we muſt not take it ſo as if ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhold neglect or forget the remembrance either of that which went before his death, or of that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> came after his death, we muſt remember them alſo; we muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> went before his death, as his birth, his life, his meanneſſe, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of his humiliation: alſo we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16098:178"/>that which followed after his death, namely, his reſurrection, his aſcenſion, and other parts of his glorification: for Chriſt is given wholly unto us in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and therefore we muſt receive him wholly, for all the paſſages of our Saviour Chriſt before his death, in his death, and after his death, they all make up together one and the ſame worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore all theſe paſſages muſt bee wrapt up together in one and the ſame apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ours. Wee muſt remember the death of Chriſt eſpecially in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, but yet under the comprehenſion of the death of Chriſt, wee muſt meditate upon thoſe things that went before his death, and thoſe things that came after his death, every thing in their kinde, and in their place and order: this we are to underſtand by the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Next, it is faid here, the <hi>Lords</hi> death. By the <hi>Lord</hi> wee are to underſtand the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>who is Lord over all, bleſſed for evermore.</hi> Chriſt is the Lord by nature and being: as the Father is Lord, and the Holy Ghoſt Lord, ſo alſo is Chriſt the Lord by nature and being: But yet Chriſt is intituled to the name <hi>Lord,</hi> by a kinde of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and ſpecialtie in regard of his office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, wherby hee is Lord over all; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Lord over his Church. And wee muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that our Saviour Chriſt is more uſually called Lord at the time of his Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and afterwards, then hee was before. The Reaſon of it is this, becauſe howſoever our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16098:178"/>Chriſt was Lord alwayes, and even in the dayes of his fleſh, did many wayes ſhew forth himſelfe to be Lord, yet notwithſtanding at his death, and afterwards, he did then eſpecially and moſt certainly prove himſelfe to be the Lord; and then hee did moſt manifeſtly ſhew and declare himſelfe to be the Lord, by doing that then, which never any could doe but the Lord himſelfe. What the things are ſhall bee ſhewed (God willing) by and by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lords death!</hi> ſome may ſay, this ſeemes to be a ſtrange ſpeech. Here are but two words, and yet they ſeeme to imply a flat contradiction one to another. If hee be the Lord, how could hee dye? And if he dyed, how could he be the Lord? Could the Lord dye?</p>
            <p>For anſwer hereunto, wee muſt conſider, that our Saviour Chriſt conſiſteth of two natures, God and Man: he is perfectly God and Lord, and withall, hee is perfectly Man: and by reaſon of the union of theſe two natures, his Godhead and his Manhood in one and the ſame Perſon Chriſt, there ariſeth a certaine communion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of both theſe natures, whereby that which is proper unto Chriſt as hee is God, is yet affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him; even as he is Man: and whereby on the other ſide, that which is proper unto Chriſt, as he is man, is affirmed of him, as hee is God. It is a deepe myſtery of our faith, and yet a neceſſary point to be knowne; for without the knowledge of this, wee cannot rightly know Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I deſire to make it plaine. Chriſt I ſay, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16098:179"/>God or Lord, and perfectly man: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that theſe two natures his Godhead and his manhood are ſo nearly united into one and the ſame perſon of the Sonne of God, hence it comes to paſſe that there is a communication of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, that is to ſay, thoſe things that are proper to him as he is God, are affirmed of him as hee is man, and thoſe things that are proper to him as he is man, are affirmed of him as he is God. To give an inſtance of the firſt: thoſe things as are proper to Chriſt as he is God, are affirmed of him as he is man. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. <hi>For no man aſcended up to heaven, but he that hath deſcended from heaven, even the Sonne of man which is in heaven:</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt ſpeakes it of himſelfe, <hi>even the Sonne of man that is in heaven:</hi> when our Saviour Chriſt ſpake theſe words hee was upon the earth, and not in heaven as he was man, and yet there it is ſaid, <hi>the Sonne of man that is in heaven,</hi> as though then hee were in heaven at that inſtant, even as the Sonne of man. How can theſe ſtand together, he being man was on earth and yet in heaven at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? The doubt is clearly anſwered thus: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſt conſiſting of two natures, God and Man, perfectly God, and perfectly Man, and then you ſhall finde by reaſon of this union in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that well may the properties of the one be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the other: Chriſt the Sonne of man is alſo the Son of God: and as God, ſo he was then and alwayes in heaven; and becauſe God and Man in Chriſt are but one perſon, therefore Chriſt the Son of man is ſaid then to be in heaven:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16098:179"/>The Sonne of God was then in heaven; Chriſt the Son of Man is the Sonne of God; therefore Chriſt the Sonne of man was even then in heaven. One thing muſt be obſerved for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this myſtery, and that is this, namely, that thoſe properties that belong to God are affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Chriſt as he is man, and ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but we muſt underſtand it of the perſon of Chriſt, and not of the natures of Chriſt, that is to ſay, for the perſon of Chriſt, to ſpeak of Chriſt in his perſon it is a true and a neceſſary rule, the property of Chriſt as he is God is affirmed of him as he is man, but in regard of the natures it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that that which is proper to the nature of man is not to be affirmed of the nature of God: to ſay that the Godhead dyes, that is blaſphemy; but to ſay that the manhood dies, that is true: If Chriſt ſhold have ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13 my manhood that in heaven; that had beene an untrue ſpeech, for that was not then in heaven: but that he in regard of his Godhead, and the union of the two natures, was in heaven, that is a moſt true and holy ſpeech: The reaſon why we muſt put this difference, is, becauſe Chriſt hath but one perſon, his manhood hath his ſubſiſtence in the perſon of the Sonne of God; ſo that Chriſt both God and Man is but one perſon: but the natures, that is to ſay, his Godhead and his manhood, are ſtill diſtinct and ſeverall things, notwithſtanding the union of the perſon.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, that which is likewiſe proper to Chriſt as he is man, the ſame is affirmed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16098:180"/>of him as he is God: As for example, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>That which ſhall be borne of thee ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> That Chriſt ſhould be borne of the bleſſed Virgin, in reſpect of his Godhead, is blaſphemy to imagine; but becauſe Chriſt in reſpect of his manhood was borne of the bleſſed Virgin, and the ſame Chriſt man was alſo Chriſt the Son of God, therefore by reaſon of this neare union of the two natures in one and the ſame perſon of the Son of God, it is truly ſaid that Chriſt the Son of God was borne of the bleſſed Virgin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. there it is ſaid that God purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Church by his owne blood: if a man ſhould ſpeake this of himſelfe, it might ſeeme blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but God ſpake it, and therefore it is true, it is ſpoken of Chriſt, for it is he alone that hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it; and it is a proper thing to purchaſe it as he was man, but not as he was God; for man hath blood, God hath none: yet notwithſtanding by reaſon of the union of theſe two natures it is ſaid that God purchaſed his Church by his blood, becauſe the ſame Chriſt that is man is alſo God, and therefore truly may it be ſaid, God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it, &amp;c. So here, the Lords death, ſaith the Text: that Chriſt dyed, this is a proper thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him as he was man, but as he is Chriſt the Lord it is not ſo proper; yet it is affirmed to be the Lords death, that is by reaſon of the neare union of theſe two natures, and therefore that which is proper to Chriſt as he is man, is affirmed of him as he is God, this is a deepe myſtery; and yet notwithſtanding it may reaſonably well bee
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16098:180"/>conceived of us: it agrees with the whole current of the Scripture, and therefore we muſt hold it as an undoubted truth: the matter being thus cleare concerning the Lords death, let us come to the Doctrines that hence ariſe for our inſtruction, <hi>the death of the Lord,</hi> the doctrine hence to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is this:</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> That howſoever Chriſt Ieſus was ſhamefully crucified, and put to a moſt ignominious and cruell death upon the Croſſe as ever any man could be put unto, yet notwithſtanding even in that ſtate of his death he was then the Lord, and ſtill ſhewed himſelfe to be the Lord, even the glorious Lord of heaven and earth. The doctrine containes two branches, and each of them is to be proved ſeverally. The one is, that Chriſt was the Lord in his death; and the other is that Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe to bee Lord in his death: This I take to be the reach of the Text, that he was the Lord in his death. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Let all the houſe of Iſraell now know for a ſurety, that God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt, this Ieſus I ſay whom ye have crucified.</hi> Marke it, he ſpeakes there of Chriſt in regard of his death, <hi>This Ieſus whom ye have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> and in that ſtate he calls him Lord, <hi>God hath made him Lord, even this Ieſus whom ye have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> ſo that Chriſt was Lord even when hee was crucified. See how the Apoſtle layes theſe termes together, <hi>the Lord, and Chriſt, and Ieſus.</hi> Some man may ſay, It may be he was the Lord before his death, but not in his death, or elſe after his death: but the Apoſtle ſhewes that he was Lord
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16098:181"/>even in his death: ſo long as hee was Chriſt and Ieſus, ſo long he was Lord, but he was Ieſus and Chriſt in his death, and therefore he was Lord in his death. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.15. <hi>God hath glorified his Sonne Ieſus whom ye betrayed and denyed; ye have killed the Lord of life whom God hath raiſed from the dead.</hi> He ſpeakes there of Chriſt in the ſtate of his death; he calls him the Sonne of God, that is to ſay, hee was the Lord when he was betrayed, when hee was denyed, and when he was killed, yet he was the Lord ſtill in all that meane eſtate. When they had him in their bloody clutches, yet ſtill he was the Lord; when they killed him, yet ſtill he was the Lord of life: <hi>Ye have killed the Lord of life,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Which none of the Princes of this world have knowne, for had they knowne him they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> Mark, the Text ſaith, <hi>they have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> though they knew him not to bee the Lord of glory, yet God knew it that he was the Lord of glory whom they crucified; hee called him the Lord of glory even when he was crucified. Marke it, glory and ſhame are moſt directly contrary one to another, even as the Eaſt is to the Weſt, or Heaven to Hell: to be crucified is the greateſt ſhame that ever can befall man; to be the Lord of glory is the higheſt and the greateſt degree of glory that ever can be conceived of God. Chriſt being crucified was the Lord of glory even in that low, and baſe, and meane eſtate, in that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate of his, ſtill hee was the Lord, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord of heaven and earth, and ſo he ſhewed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16098:181"/>himſelfe to be the Lord of glory: which is the next point, and the other branch of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and now to be proved. For proofe of that look into <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. there the Apoſtle tells us that Chriſt whileſt he was <hi>of no reputation,</hi> whileſt he was in <hi>the form of a ſervant,</hi> whileſt he humbled himſelfe <hi>to the death of the Croſſe,</hi> all this while he was equall with God, hee was the Lord all this while, even in all the time of his crucifying. In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh verſes, there you ſhall ſee he ſhewed himſelfe to bee the Lord of glory: wherefore the Lord <hi>hath given him a name above all names, that at the name of Ieſus ſhould every knee bow, both of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: and that every tongue ſhould confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lord unto the glory of God the Father.</hi> As Chriſt was the Lord when he was crucified, ſo hee ſhewed himſelfe to bee the Lord when he was crucified: for then was that done by Chriſt in regard of his obedience, by which, and for which hee did obtaine a name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all names, and he did juſtly deſerve to bee acknowledged a Lord of all Lords, a glorious Lord, that at <hi>the name of him ſhould every knee bow, and every tongue ſhould confeſſe that he is the Lordun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glory of God the Father:</hi> So that Chriſt did doe that upon the Croſſe, whereby hee ſhewed himſelfe to be Lord. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. there it is ſaid that <hi>Chriſt was declared mightily to be the Sonne of God.</hi> He ſpeakes there of our Saviour Chriſt, and calls him the Sonne of God, that is to ſay, the Lord. He ſaith, <hi>He was declared mightily to be Sonne of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16098:182"/>God:</hi> and how, I pray you? <hi>By the ſpirit of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Now this you muſt underſtand, that the power whereby Chriſt raiſed himſelfe from death, was in him whileſt he was in the ſtate of death, and whileſt Chriſt lay in the grave, then was this power in him to raiſe up himſelfe; now by this power hee ſhewed himſelfe to be the Sonne of God, to bee the Lord; and it is a mighty declaration of him to be the Sonne of God, and therefore Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe mightily to be the Lord, even in the ſtate of his death. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.42. the Thiefe he gives teſtimony to this truth: our Saviour being upon the Croſſe, he ſaith, <hi>O Lord remember mee when thou commeſt into thy kingdome.</hi> Thoſe that crucified him did not ſee nor take notice that hee was the Lord, but the poore Thiefe did ſee him to be the Lord, and did know that hee was the Lord, and he beleeved in him, and called upon him as the Lord; wee never reade that ever he did know before that he was the Lord; nothing brought him to know Chriſt to be the Lord, but that which he diſcerned in him upon the Croſſe. So the Centurion in <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.44. the Text ſaith, that the Centurion and others that ſaw thoſe fearfull things that came to paſſe at the death of Chriſt, <hi>Of a truth,</hi> ſay they, <hi>this man was the Sonne of God.</hi> The Centurion, for ought we know, did never know nor take notice that this man was the Sonne of God, till he came to behold his death; but when he came to behold him on the Croſſe by the eye of Faith, he ſaw ſuch evident ſignes of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16098:182"/>him to be the Lord, that hee perſwaded himſelfe and takes his oath of it, and ſaith, <hi>Of a truth, this man is the Son of God;</hi> howſoever it is that they killed him, yet <hi>of a truth this was the Sonne of God.</hi> In the 51. and 52. verſes, thoſe fearfull accidents that are mentioned there, as the veile renting, the Rockes cleaving aſunder, the graves opening, and many of the bodies of the Saints that ſlept aroſe, what did all this ſhew, but that Chriſt did clearly manifeſt himſelfe, and prove himſelfe to bee the Lord even in his death, that the dead and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures were ſenſible of it; the earth, the ſtones and graves diſcerned it, and the bodies of the Saints that were dead diſcerned it, and did acknowledge it in their kinde? What a fearfull upbraiding to the Iewes was this? that either they did not ſee Chriſt to be the Lord, or would not ſee him nor acknowledge him, when the very ſtones and other inſenſible creatures were ſenſible of it. So then you ſee the Doctrine is clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Scripture, that Chriſt Ieſus, howſoever he was ſhamefully crucified, and put to a moſt cruell and ignominious death, as ever any man could be putunto, yet (notwithſtanding) even in that ſtate of his death he was the Lord, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to be the Lord, the glorious Lord of heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the Doctrine are theſe:<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> The firſt is this; Hee was the Lord, and ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the Lord over his Church. The firſt Reaſon (I ſay) is drawne from his Church: Chriſt Ieſus in his death was Lord over his Church, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16098:183"/>ſo ſhewed himſelfe to be; for then indeed by his death he did purchaſe and redeeme his Church, he bought his Church; then the faithfull were his owne by actuall redemption. You know that thoſe things which a man purchaſes and buyes at a deare rate, and gives for them as much as they are worth, they are his owne by a true title. If ſo be that any man do redeem a man out of the gallies, he is truly his Lord, in the right kind of owning; and the other is his ſervant. Chriſt when he was upon the croſſe, then did he purchaſe and buy his Church by his blood, and then therein he ſhewed himſelfe in a moſt right ſenſe to bee the Lord of his Church: then were they his owne by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all redemption: and this is that which the Saints did acknowledge, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Oh worthy art thou to take the Booke, and to open the ſeale thereof:</hi> and why is he worthy more than any other? <hi>Becauſe thou waſt killed, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood;</hi> and therefore thou haſt a true intereſt into us, and thou art ſurely our Lord, and worthy art thou ſo to bee acknowledged. And our Saviour gives ſome intimation of it in the 18. of <hi>Iohn, If I were lifted up from the earth,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I would draw all men unto me:</hi> What is meant by lifting up? that is to ſay, his crucifying: If I were crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I would draw all men after me. The reach of the place is this; That Chriſt by his crucifying, and his death, drawes all men, and gathers all his Church to himſelfe; he purchaſes them, and makes them his owne by redemption, that he may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their Lord, and they his people, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16098:183"/>ſervants: and ſurely as Chriſt did gather all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from the beginning of the world, by the power of his word, and death, and bleſſed Spirit, ſo ſpecially in the actuall performance of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, then chiefly did he draw all men unto him: for then his Lordſhip, after a ſpeciall manner was advanced, and the territories of his kingdome were much inlarged; and now no longer was it to be bound, and to be contained within the borders of Iudea, but to have dominion from ſea to ſea, unto the worlds end. Oh what a mighty Lord did he ſhew himſelfe to be even in his death!</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Secondly, as he was Lord over the Church, ſo he was, and ſo hee ſhewed himſelfe to be even a Lord over his enemies. What is the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Lord, or whereby doth a man come to be moſt juſtly and rightly called Lord, but by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing his enemies under him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footſtoole.</hi> Here is a true and a right Lord, when he can ſubdue and trample his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet. Chriſt being upon the croſſe in his death, then (indeed) did he eſpecially van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and trample his enemies under his feet, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and all his inſtruments. Then he tooke them downe to their greateſt ſhame, to their irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſſe, and utter ruine for ever. See how the Apoſtle ſpeakes of it, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Hee hath ſpoyled Principalities and Powers, and hath made a ſhew of them openly, and hath triumphed over them in the Croſſe.</hi> What bee the enemies that our Saviour Chriſt hath? why, they are Principalities and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16098:184"/>Powers; he hath vanquiſhed them all, the Devill and his Angells, not onely as a man would ſay petty Devills, but Belzebub himſelfe, Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers: and if there be any ſtronger, and mightier, and greater than the reſt, Chriſt hath ſubdued them all. And how hath hee ſubdued them? He hath ſpoiled them, ſaith the Text; he hath ſubdued them even as a man ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all that a man hath; ſo Chriſt, he hath ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theſe Principalities and Powers, he hath taken away their weapons, their forces, and power from them, yea and their hearts too in ſome ſort; they know they ſhall never overcome Gods children. <hi>He hath ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and made ſhew of them openly.</hi> It is ſpeech that is drawn from a Conqueror, and hath beene in warre, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victory, and comming into the Citie, hee brings thofe that hee hath taken captives with him, and he rides in great jollity up and downe, as who ſhould ſay, theſe are my captives that I have overcome: ſo <hi>hath Chriſt ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and made ſhew of them openly, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over them,</hi> ſaith the Text: he hath gotten himſelfe agreat victory. Chriſt did not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them, but hee triumphed over them; that is to ſay, he trode them under foot as a baſe thing, never able to riſe up againe. But where, how, and when, and by what meanes, was all this done? Why, upon the Croſſe, ſaith the Text: So then Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe to be a Lord in his death upon the croſſe. Conſider the ſtate of the buſineſſe as then it was; conſider Satan, and all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16098:184"/>the powers of darkneſſe; they were then in the greateſt hope that could bee, as they thought; when they had once gotten Chriſt upon the croſs the greateſt poſſibility that ever they had againſt him. On the other ſide, Chriſt was in the moſt unlikelieſt condition to overcome, and to deliver us, and moſt likelieſt to have beene overcome, and to be made a prey unto them.</p>
            <p>Conſider againe in the next place, the Devill and his inſtruments were in the height of their malicious pride and power; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Now is the very houre and power of darkneſſe:</hi> and Chriſt on the otherſide, he was in the deepeſt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirmitie forſaken of God, in his apprehenſion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of all the world, made a prey to his enemies, no way to acquit himſelfe, or to raiſe up himſelfe, his ſoule being heavie euen to the death: conſider theſe things (I ſay) they being in this faire hope, and upon the top of their pride, and Chriſt in the deepeſt of his miſery: now that Chriſt ſhould free himſelfe from them all, ſo that not a bone of him was broken, nor a haire off his head did periſh, and not onely ſo that he ſhould ſo acquit himſelfe from the Devill, but ſhould acquit all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that this hee ſhould doe to the utter breaking of the power of Satan; for all thoſe that have true right and intereſt into the death of Chriſt; oh what a glorious Lord did Chriſt ſhew himſelfe to bee, when hee was upon the Croſſe, there he did breake the Serpents head. <hi>Iudges</hi> 16.12, 13. when the Philiſtimes had gotten <hi>Samſon,</hi> and had him in their power, that they could doe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16098:185"/>with him what they liſt, and had plucked out his eyes, and inſulted over him in that miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; now were the Princes of the Philiſtims in their greateſt jollity: the ſervant of God, (at leaſt for that buſineſſe he was the ſervant of God) what doth he in this caſe? <hi>He ſaid unto the ſervant that led him by the hand, Lead mee that I may touch the pillars that the houſe ſtandeth upon, and that I may leane to them;</hi> and after his prayer, <hi>he bowed himſelfe with all his might</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and the houſe fell upon them all, and ſo they were ſlaine, and he killed more at his death, than in all his life.</hi> So Chriſt, hee was in the hands of Satan and his inſtruments, and they had him upon the croſſe, they mocked and ſcoffed at him, and did unto him as they would; but then he bowed himſelfe upon the Croſſe, and yeelded up the ghoſt, and brought deſtruction upon them all, and thoſe that he ſlew at the houre of his death were infinitly more than thoſe whom he overthrew all his life time.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> The fourth Reaſon, as it was ſo that Chriſt was the Lord, and Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe to be the Lord in his death upon the croſſe, ſo we will adde one reaſon to prove the neceſſity of it, that it muſt be ſo, namely, becauſe of his office, he muſt be the head of the Church, hee muſt be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Redeemer, and that in his very death, therefore he muſt be the Lord. It is true, that there be ſome things that he was to performe as he was man, and belonged to him as he was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, but yet there were ſome things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as Redeemer, that could not be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but as he was the Lord of heaven and earth: it was part of our Saviours office as hee was Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to reveale the will of the Lord unto us; who knowes the will of the Lord, but the Lord himſelfe? It was part of our Saviours office to forgive ſinnes, who can forgive ſinnes but God
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16098:186"/>alone? It is a part of his office to redeeme us, and deliver us out of the power of damnation; except he had beene the Lord he could not have done it; who can redeeme us but the Lord? to deliver himſelfe out of that great extremity that he was in, was more than the worke of a man: but if hee could have rid himſelfe as being a man of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grace and ſtrength to paſſe thorough ſuch pikes as never any other man could, yet he could not have beene our Redeemer, by delivering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to deliver us, without he had beene God: there muſt bee infinite knowledge in the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that he may take notice of all the Saints of God from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, this cannot be in any but in God onely. Againe, there muſt be infinite mercy in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to forgive ſinnes, there muſt bee infinite wiſedome in him to make all the redeemed wiſe to God and to their owne ſalvation; in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer there muſt be infinite grace effectuall to call all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved; alſo there muſt be in him infinite power to ſave our ſoules; to ſave any one ſoule is a matter of infinite power, and therefore much more to ſave ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſoules as are from time to time called and converted unto the Lord.

            <p>The uſe firſt that ſhewes us that God doth oft times worke by quite contraries in the matter of ſalvation, as who ſhould ſay, he ſets one contrary againſt another, and brings the greateſt good out of the greateſt evill: Chriſt is the Lord in his very death, in his moſt cruell and ſhamefull death; he was much magnified when hee was moſt debaſed, the Lord of life and glory when he was killed and crucified: thus it was with Chriſt, and ſo it is in the members of Chriſt: it was ſo in him, that we may expect this in our ſelves, and ſo wee finde it by experience how God workes with many of his, children: are they not ofttimes moſt glorious in their greateſt abaſement, &amp; moſt comfortable in their greateſt afflictions? and are we not then oft times moſt neare to God, when we thinke our ſelves farre from God? are we not moſt ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heavenly minded even in the moſt helliſh temptations of Satan that we are exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? thoſe that are in the ſtate of grace know this to be true: this is not ſenſible to the naturall man, nor yet to the ſpirituall man many times for the preſent, yet afterwards hee ſees it, and can ſay, Surely the Lord is with me, and I was not aware. Looke but into an example of <hi>Paul</hi> in the like temptation: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. the Apoſtle prayeth againſt the temptations of Satan, the anſwer of God to him is this, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, my power is perfect in thy weakneſſe:</hi> and thereupon the Apoſtle ſers his reſt, and ſaith, <hi>When I am weak, then I am ſtrong.</hi> Here you ſee that in matters of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16098:187"/>ſalvation God oft-times worketh by contraries, ſhewing himſelfe a ſtrong God in a weake man: a ſtrange thing that God ſhold perfect his ſtrength in mans weakneſſe: a man would think he ſhould perfect his ſtrength in our ſtrength, but he doth it in our weakneſſe: My ſtrength, ſaith hee, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in thy weakneſſe: So in the caſe of <hi>Stephen,</hi> in the matter of perſecution, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. the laſt verſe, when he was there before the Councell, they that ſate in Councell looking upon him, they beheld his face as the face of an Angel, they admired him in that ſtate of his baſeneſſe, as a glorious Angell. It is not unſeaſonable for God ſo to worke by contraries, for it magnifies the great and almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power and wiſedome of God, that can worke by contraries; and it magnifies the great mercy and goodneſſe of God, that he will doe ſo for us, that when we are weakeſt, then we are ſtrongeſt, that God commandeth light to ſhine unto us out of darkneſſe, and makes our greateſt miſery a meere ſtep to our greateſt glory.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> Laſtly, the laſt Vſe is matter of exhortation to ſtirre us up that we ſhould looke to our ſelves in the meditation of Chriſt his death, alwayes to think upon Chriſt the Lord of glory, whenſoever thou doſt enter into meditation of the death of Chriſt either at the Sacrament, or not at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet ſtill let thy eye of faith be fixed upon Chriſt the Lord: to meditate of Chriſt his death, is to meditate upon the Lords death: It is true indeed that wee cannot apprehend Chriſt dying for us but onely as man, as God he could not dye;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16098:188"/>yet it is not ſufficient to beleeve in Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as man, for whoſoever beleeves in Chriſt as a crucified man, if he ſtay there, and if his faith goe not one ſtep further, to ſay I beleeve in the Lord crucified, he is in a moſt miſerable and damnable caſe. When once we come to relliſh the Lord in the death of Chriſt, then is his death moſt ſweet and comfortable unto us; this will make a great many of living ſprings of waters to riſe up in our hearts, when we meditate upon the death of the Lord Chriſt, that we can ſay, the Lord hath died for me; this will worke reverence and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us, and therefore we muſt highly eſteeme of it, not as the death of a man, but as the death of the Lord: the Lord dyed for mee, Oh, how thankfull ought I to be to the Lord for this great kindneſſe! what am I poore ſinfull wretch, that Chriſt the Lord ſhould dye for mee! this will teach us to love the Lord; Oh, how ſhould wee love the glorious Lord of heaven and earth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord of heaven and earth hath ſo loved us as to dye for us! Alſo it teacheth us patience, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt the Lord hath dyed for us, therefore we muſt not thinke much to ſuffer temptation and affliction, yea death it ſelfe; Chriſt the Lord hath gone through theſe before, and therefore no doubt but he will bring us through the like, with joy and with comfort. Chriſt the Lord hath dyed for us, this will breed and worke faith and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in us; we may be bold to hazard our ſoules upon Chriſt, knowing that our ſalvation is ſure and firme: it is the Lord that hath wrought it by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16098:188"/>his death, and it is not all the Devills in hell can diſanull that ſalvation which the Lord hath wrought for us. Againe, it miniſters matter of rejoycing, that we doe not onely beleeve in Chriſt crucified, but we rejoyce in Chriſt crucified. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce, but in the croſſe unto me, and I unto the world:</hi> this Croſſe I oppoſe againſt all my feares, afflictions, and temptations, and perſecutions, againſt all that ever can come: I am crucified to the world, and the world to me, becauſe the Lord hath dyed for me. Laſtly, this is a matter of excellent comfort to Gods children, for hereby we may diſcerne the infinite worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the death of Chriſt, and the infinite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe of his death: Why was the death of Chriſt ſo precious? why, becauſe it was the death of Chriſt the Lord; not the death of Chriſt as he was man, but of Chriſt the Lord of life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. When wee conſider that ſo many thouſand ſhall be ſaved, wee thinke with our ſelves, how ſhall theſe bee ſaved; why, the infinite blood of the Lord is ſufficient for us al: this death, being the Lords death it muſt needs be of force and power, and vertue and merit, to procure mercy, and grace and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to all thoſe that have a true faith, and doe earneſtly endeavour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be conformable to this death of Chriſt.</p>

            <head>THE SEVENTEENTH LECTVRE VPON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORDS SVPPER.</head>
            <p>NOw wee are to proceed, as God ſhall inable us, in the handling of the 26. verſe of the 11. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, becauſe this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noones exerciſe we muſt ſpend in the matter of preparation againſt the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, for the receiving of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as ye ſhall eate this bread, and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till hee come.</hi> We divided this Scripture, as you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, into theſe two parts: firſt, an action to bee performed, in the former part of the verſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, ſet forth here by the name of <hi>eating this bread, and drinking this cup.</hi> Secondly, the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that this action is to bee performed withall,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16098:190"/>that we have in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> In this caution in the latter part of the verſe, we obſerved the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe, namely, <hi>to ſhew forth the Lords death:</hi> ſecondly, the often uſing, or the often obſerving of this caution: For though that be not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, yet it is to be ſupplyed out of the former part of the verſe, and is in common underſtanding to be read thus, As often as ye ſhall eat this bread and drinke this cup, ſo often yee ſhew forth the Lords death till he come. Thirdly and laſtly, here is the continuance of it, how long this is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, why till the end of the world, till the day of Iudgement, till the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; <hi>ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the caution, firſt we obſerved the matter that is to be remembred, that is the Lords death: then ſecondly, we told you here wee muſt conſider of the manner of the remembring of it: how muſt it be remembred? by a ſhewing forth, by a lively and a kinde of ſenſible expreſſing of it, <hi>yee ſhew; forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> Concerning the matter to bee remembred, namely, the Lords death, there wee ſhewed you firſt what is meant by the death of the Lord, namely, both the act of his death in reſpect of himſelfe, and likewiſe the benefit of his death in reſpect of us, for that alſo muſt be remembred in the receiving of the Sacrament. Then when as it is ſaid here, it is the Lords death, I ſhewed you that howſoever Chriſt as he was Lord could not dye, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death that Chriſt did ſuffer is rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16098:190"/>the death of the Lord, becauſe Chriſt being man was alſo God and Lord: yet by reaſon of the union of both theſe natures in one and the ſame perſon, therefore that which is proper to Chriſt as he is man, is rightly affirmed of him as being God and Lord.</p>
            <p>And thence we drew this obſervation, in that it is here called the Lords death, namely, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt Ieſus was cruelly and ſhamefully crucified and put to a moſt cruel and ignominious death upon the Croſſe as ever any man could bee put unto, yet notwithſtanding even in that ſtate of his death he was the Lord, and ſhewed himſelf to be the glorious Lord of heaven and earth. It followes now that we are to goe on: Wee have ſpoken hitherto touching the Lords death as it is conſidered abſolutely in it ſelfe, we are yet further to ſpeake of the Lords death by way of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by way of reference of it to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; for ſo you ſee here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes of it reſpectively unto this Supper, <hi>As often as ye ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come:</hi> where by it is plaine, that looke what the Apoſtle ſpeakes here concerning the Lords death, the ſame is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined expreſſety to the reference of the Lords death, to the Lords Supper: we muſt alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the death of the Lord Chriſt Ieſus; every one of us that looke to have any part, or to have any benefit by it, muſt remember it at all times; but yet when as we come to communicate in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, then there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16098:191"/>of us a more ſpeciall meditation thereof than generally at other times. Again, even in the participation of the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we muſt meditate upon whole Chriſt, Chriſt borne, Chriſt living, Chriſt dying, Chriſt buried, Chriſt riſen againe; for Chriſt was given wholly for us upon the Croſſe, and Chriſt is given whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto us in the Lords Supper, and therfore there we muſt receive Chriſt wholly, and meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whole Chriſt. I but yet in this caſe when wee come to receive the Sacrament, then wee muſt more meditate, and our hearts, and our mindes muſt more runne upon the death of Chriſt than upon any thing elſe that ever Chriſt did or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us: it is the death of the Lord that we muſt take ſpeciall notice of in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>

               </label> The Doctrine then and the obſervation that here arifeth for our inſtruction, is this, namely, The principall object, the chiefe matter that is to be conſidered and meditated upon in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is the Lords death, or the death of the Lord Chriſt Ieſus. In the 22. of <hi>Luke,</hi> at the 19. verſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour being inſtituting and adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, takes the bread, and breaks it, and gives it to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>This is my body which is given for you, doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me:</hi> it is not enough for us when we come to the Sacrament, to meditate upon Chriſt his body, as being the body of a living man: but <hi>This is my body which is given for you, doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16098:191"/>of me:</hi> we muſt meditate upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt as it is given for us, as it was broken for us, as it was crucified for us, as it was put to death for us, and this is the right remembrance of the death of Chriſt in the ſacrament of the Lords Supper: and likewiſe concerning the other part, namely, the cup and the wine, it followes in the twentieth verſe, <hi>This cup is the New Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>this is my blood in the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for you; this is my blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> When we come to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, we come to receive the blood of Chriſt ſpiritually, ſacramentally: we doe not receive the blood of Chriſt there as being a living thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt, we doe not receive the blood of Chriſt as it is contained within the veſſell and veines of his body; but we receive the blood of Chriſt that is ſhed for us, that he poured out for us, for the remiſſion of our ſins, that is the right object that the hand of the faith of every true beleever doth ſeize and lay hold upon in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, not the body, but the body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for us, the body given for us; not the blood, but the blood ſhed and poured out for us; not ſimply Chriſt, but Chriſt dying for us; it is that which is the principall matter of the Sacrament. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? the bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> The Apoſtle likewiſe ſpeakes there of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: What is it that the Lord doth communicate unto us in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16098:192"/>Sacrament of the Lords Supper on his part? the body and blood of Chriſt; that is to ſay, the death of Chriſt. What is it that we doe communicate in? that we receive from God on our parts the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame thing that God gives unto us, the body and blood of Chriſt, that is to ſay, the death of Chriſt. Why then it is the body and blood of Chriſt, that is communicated unto us, (which cannot be communicated unto us without it bee broken &amp; ſhed) that is it I ſay which we receive in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and that is the thing that is chiefly therein to bee reſpected. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Hee that eates and drinkes unworthily, eates and drinkes his owne damnation.</hi> All of us are unworthy receivers of this Sacrament: who is worthy of ſuch great things as theſe are? we bring with us many failings and imperfections to the Lords table: the beſt of us all let us prepare our ſelves as well as we can, yet for theſe failings of ours we are to be humbled before the Lord, and to ſtrive againſt them: but though we have theſe failings, yet if ſo be we diſcerne the Lords body, that is to ſay, if our faith doth rightly ſeize upon the death of Chriſt in the Sacrament, here is the principall matter that is to be looked unto: I ſay, if we rightly apprehend the death of Chriſt in the Sacrament, then the principall is whole, our fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and our imperfections the Lord will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly paſſe by them, and he will pardon them in mercy: and though we be unworthy in reſpect of our ſelves, yet the Lord will accept us as worthy in Chriſt Ieſus. I, but on the other ſide, if we do
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16098:192"/>not diſcerne the Lords body, if when we come to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, our hearts and our faith doe not rightly lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of Chriſt, why then wee faile in the very principall of the buſineſſe: and though wee ſhould bring other graces with us, as knowledge of God, ſorrow for ſin, and the like, yet all theſe ſhall not helpe us, but ſtill we are unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: ſo we are in our ſelves, and ſo wee ſhall bee ſtill reputed of God: we ſhall be ſo farre from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any benefit, that on the contrary it ſhall turn to our judgement and condemnation, becauſe we diſcerned not the Lords body; that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we doe faile in the principall matter that is tendred unto us, namely, the death of Chriſt. Thoſe places ſhall ſuffice for the confirmation of this point out of Scripture: now to confirme it further by reaſon, the Reaſons of this Doctrine are many.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16098:193"/>that brought his beaſts, his Bulls, and his Goats to be ſacrificed for ſin, that reſted in them as if they were Sacrifices powerfull and effectuall to take away ſinne: no, ſaith the Apoſtle in the 10 to the <hi>Hebrewes, it is impoſsible that the blood of beaſts ſhould take away ſinne;</hi> and that the faithfull knew well enough; but yet they ſubmitted themſelves to thoſe ordinances, becauſe they were Gods laws, but ſtill the principall matter that they aymed at in all their ſacrifices, was the death of Chriſt, the death of the Meſſias that was to be ſlaine for the ſinnes of the whole world, for the perfect purging away of ſinne: And ſo in the Sacrament of the Paſſeover, there was never any true beleever that did eate of the paſchall Lambe, but ſtill he had an eye to the true Lamb of God that was ſlain from the beginning of the world; that as that Paſchall Lambe was a memoriall of the deliverance of the children of Iſraell out of Aegypt, and from the hands of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo the true Lambe of GOD, namely, the Sonne of God, hee ſhould come and deliver us from hell, death, and damnation: now if ſo be that it were ſo in the Sacrifices and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Old Teſtament, it muſt needs be ſo in the Sacraments of the New Teſtament too: if it were ſo with them that lived before the death of Chriſt, that had but the ſhadow in reſpect of us, how much more muſt it be ſo with us that live in the cleare light, Chriſt having already ſuffered in the fleſh. I grant, we have no ſacrifices propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory for ſinne, as they had: Chriſt Ieſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the onely true propitiation for our ſinnes,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16098:193"/>being once ſacrificed on the Croſſe, there is no further place or uſe for any other propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices whatſoever: but yet ſeeing our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as much to us as both ſacrifices and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were to the Iewes, ſtill the reaſon holds that if the ſacrifices and ſacraments of the Law tended chiefly to the meditation of the death of Chriſt Ieſus the Meſſias, as that being the chiefe object that they were therein to lay hold upon; then certainly the principall and chiefe matter in the Sacraments of the new Teſtament, and ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Lords Supper, muſt be the death of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

The reaſon ſtands thus; The death of Chriſt being the ſubſtance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, it muſt alſo be the ſubſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper; for Baptiſme we know enters us into that eſtate which the Lords Supper confirmes us in; and the Lords Supper confirmes us further in that holy eſtate, which Baptiſme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters us into: now we muſt not enter into one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and bee confirmed in another: Therefore the ſubſtance of each Sacrament muſt be one and the ſame; and ſo conſequently, the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being the ſubſtance of the one, it muſt alſo be the ſubſtance of the other.</p>

That the Sacrament is the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, it is our Saviours owne ſpeech in the 26. of <hi>Matth.</hi> verſe 28. <hi>For this is my blood of the new Teſtament that is ſhed for many for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes:</hi> there is the Sacrament called by the name of the new Teſtament; it is not properly the new Teſtament it ſelfe, but it is not called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſigne and a ſeale of the new Teſtament: now likewiſe that the Teſtament is not of force, but by the death of the Teſtator, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confirmes, in the 9. to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the 14, 15, 16, and 17, verſes, by the example of mens Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, and applyes it to the Teſtament of Chriſt Ieſus: ſaith he, <hi>The Teſtament of man is not of force till he be dead:</hi> Lay all this together, and marke it well; Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe is the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is his Teſtament, the Teſtament cannot bee of force without the death of the Teſtator: and ſo you ſee the whole force of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper conſiſts in the death of Chriſt Ieſus, and therefore that is the chiefe matter in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16098:196"/>Lord Ieſus Chriſt; they come to the Lords table, but they know not what they come about. Alas, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Such men doe but offer the ſacrifice of fooles.</hi> they doe not know they doe evill; they doe but offer the ſacrifice of fooles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not know what they doe; that is the meaning of the place, that they doe not heare or learne, they doe not underſtand, they are not well taught what it is that they muſt principally meditate upon when they come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Sily men and women that ſo come to the Lords Table, alas they know not that they doe evill, they know not that they prophane the Sacrament, in that they doe not receive the holy things of the Sacrament, that is, the death of Chriſt; they know not that they make themſelves guilty of the blood of Chriſt, in that they receive not the body and blood of Chriſt by faith: Chriſt he is tendred unto them, but they know not that they doe eate their owne damnation, in that they apprehend not the death of Ieſus Chriſt which is the chiefe matter that is there tendred unto them, and that the Lord calls them unto: they offer the ſacrifice of fooles, they know not that they doe evill. I will give you a compariſon. If ſo be that a man ſhould goe into the market to fetch ſuch and ſuch commodities that he ſtands in need of, he makes himſelfe ready, and goes forth, and makes full accompt to bring them home with him, but the fooliſh man never conſiders the price of theſe things, what they will coſt him, and ſo hee takes no money to pay for them, when as the price is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16098:196"/>the chiefeſt thing to be reſpected in that he goes about, but he never conſiders that: Is not this a ridiculous man? is not that man like to come home as fooliſh and as emptie as he went out? It is ſo with many of our Communicants; many here come to the Lords Table; for what, forſooth? to furniſh themſelves with ſuch and ſuch commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, for to receive the holy Sacrament, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Chriſt, for to receive remiſſion of ſinnes, and grace, and comfort, and ſuch like; theſe they come to receive, I but they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the price of theſe things: what is that? the death of Chriſt, for theſe things coſt Chriſt Ieſus his moſt precious blood: they doe not bring faith in their hearts, whereby to purchaſe and get theſe things for themſelves, therefore ſuch men goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as fooliſh and ridiculous, and as empty of grace as ever they were before; yea they are ſo much the more damnable, becauſe they come thus unfurniſhed. It is with many of us as it was with the Iewes that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of in the 2. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 14, 15. <hi>Their mindes are hardned, for unto this day remaineth the ſame covering untaken away in the reading of the old Teſtament, which veile in Chriſt is put away: but even unto this day, when Moſes is read, the veile is laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their hearts.</hi> They could ſee the outward things, the ſacrifices, the ceremonies, and the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the old Teſtament, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes; I, but ſaith the Apoſtle, they could not looke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end, they could not looke unto the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe things that were tendred unto
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16098:197"/>them in this outward ſhadow, that is to ſay, they could not looke upon Chriſt, that is the ſubſtance of all; no, ſaith the Apoſtle, there is a veile over their hearts, and to this day they continue in their hardneſſe: ſo I ſay it is with many among us, wee come here unto the Lords Table, we can ſee theſe outward things well enough, the bread and the wine; I but yet many of us doe not looke to the end of theſe things, to the ſubſtance that is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto us in theſe holy myſteries, namely, to the death of Chriſt; wee doe not diſcerne the Lords body; there is a veile over the hearts of many of us, a covering of blindneſs over the harts of many of us, therefore though we doe come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, this month, and the next month, yet ſtill wee continue in the hardneſſe of our hearts: we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better till this veile be taken away, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Iewes; till this veile be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by Chriſt, till Chriſt Ieſus doe take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this veile of blindneſſe, and ſhew them his death, and preſent his death unto them, and cauſe them to <hi>looke upon him whom they have pierced,</hi> till ſuch time that this veile be taken away, and that he preſent his death to their hearts by his Spirit, they ſhall never be the better for it, they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their hardneſſe, and they ſhall continue in their hardneſſe for ever. Therefore, beloved, let us not deceive our ſelves, to thinke that wee are more holy and religious receivers than indeed we are: let us try our ſelves when wee come to the Lords Table, examine our ſelves upon this point, what apprehenſion we have of the death
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16098:197"/>of Chriſt, what portion wee have in the death of Chriſt, and accordingly as thou findeſt ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this grace within thee, ſo come, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a bleſſing from God: but if thou have a veile before thee, and thou canſt not ſee and behold the death of Chriſt, that is to ſay, Chriſt Ieſus cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the taking away of thy ſinnes, ſurely thou art not in caſe to come to the Table of the Lord.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> The ſecond Vſe of this Doctrine is matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and it ſerves to inſtruct us in many good Chriſtian duties. Is it ſo, that the very ſubſtance and the chiefeſt matter of the Lords Supper is the death of Chriſt Ieſus, then this ſhould teach us in the firſt place that wee ſhould hunger and thirſt &amp; long after this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: we muſt hunger &amp; thirſt after grace, we muſt hunger &amp; thirſt after righteouſneſſe: the death of Ieſus Chriſt is our grace, and our righteouſneſſe, and the ſame alſo is the ſubſtance of this Sacrament; therefore wee muſt hunger and thirſt after this Sacrament. Oh, beloved, that wee could but conſider with our ſelves the worth of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, which was as great a matter as the whole world beſides: or if we could but conſider the neceſſity of the death of Chriſt, that without the ſenſe and feeling of it in our hearts it is impoſſible that any man can be ſaved: or if we could but conſider the power of the death of Chriſt, what a force it hath to beat downe the power of ſinne, hell, and death: and if we could conſider the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt crucified, the crucifying of Chriſt is the very life of a man that is truly regenerate and converted to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16098:198"/>God: if wee could but conſider the benefit of Chriſt Ieſus crucified, all grace and all glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto us by the death of Chriſt: laſtly, if we could but conſider the glory of Chriſt crucified, Chriſt was moſt glorious upon the Croſſe, when he was in the height of his obedience, and ſo God beheld him, and then indeed did he procure moſt glory to us: as it was his glory, ſo it is our chiefeſt glory: <hi>I rejoyce in nothing but in Chriſt crucified,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: If wee could ſoundly taſte of theſe things, the worthineſſe of Chriſt crucified, the neceſſity of Chriſt crucified, the power of Chriſt crucified, the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt crucified, the benefit of Chriſt crucified, the glory of Chriſt crucified, we would hunger againe and againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, after the death of Chriſt therein tendred unto us: it ſhould whet us on to a ſpirituall appetite to this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banquet.</p>
            <p>This teacheth us in the ſecond place, what bee the graces that every one of us muſt be furniſhed withall when we doe come to the Lords Table: What be the ſpeciall graces? why, all graces that are any way reſpective to the death of Chriſt; it is the death of Chriſt that there we come to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate; now becauſe every grace is in ſome ſort or other reſpective to the death of Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one of us ſhold come furniſhed in ſome meaſure or other with every grace: but yet there be ſome graces that be more proper and nearer reſpective to the death of Chriſt than others are, and theſe we muſt all be furniſhed withall when
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16098:198"/>we come to the Sacrament; they be ſo neceſſary, that if we come not with them it is damnable for us to come at all. There bee many, I will but touch theſe five; Knowledge, Faith, Love, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp; Thankfulneſſe. The firſt grace is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; we muſt bee indued with knowledge, the knowledge of God generally, and likewiſe of all other matters that be neceſſary to ſalvation; but more ſpecially the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: we muſt know the ſtory of his crucifying, the benefit and power of his crucifying; but yet more particularly we muſt know Chriſt Ieſus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in reference to the Lords Supper; there is the particular knowledge required of us, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in that Sacrament, the power of Chriſt in that Sacrament, the benefits of Chriſt in that Sacrament, theſe bee the things that wee muſt be well acquainted withall, except we know theſe things wecome in a miſerable caſe. I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you that the death of Chriſt muſt bee medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; here is the eye whereby wee doe diſcerne Chriſt crucified in theſe holy myſteries, even the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt crucified in reference to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper; and therefore as ever thou lookeſt to have any benefit by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, whoſoever thou art, ſee that thou be experienced, and well ſeene, and well grounded in the knowledge of Chriſt crucified, be not to ſeeke of this when thou doeſt come, ſee that thou have this knowledge before thou commeſt; hee that hath his money to ſeeke
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16098:199"/>when he ſhould pay for his meat, is like to faſt; ſo if we have not this knowledge before we come to the Lords Supper, if we be not well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this grace, we are like to faſt, we are like to him that hath his weapons to ſeeke when hee ſhould goe to fight, he is like to be beaten.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt bring Faith with us, that is the ſecond grace; faith to apprehend the death of Chriſt, to apprehend Ieſus Chriſt crucified, and this is as it were the hand whereby we doe apply and lay hold upon Ieſus Chriſt; for it is but in vaine for us to know Chriſt crucified, except we doe apply him to our ſelves, the eie of knowledge cannot ſave us, without we doe apply him with the hand of faith: by faith we doe as it were lay hold upon Chriſt in the Sacrament, and lay his death upon our ſores, as a plaiſter to cure them, and as a cordiall to our ſoules to comfort them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there muſt be Love in us; love to God, love to Chriſt, and love to our brethren for Gods cauſe, for the death of Ieſus Chriſt being firſt wel knowne and underſtood, then ſecondly, well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and applyed by faith, worketh in us a kind of ſenſible feeling of the love of God towards us in Chriſt Ieſus, and thereby kindles in us a love to God himſelfe and to Chriſt, and then conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to our brethren: if God hath ſo loved us, we muſt alſo love him; and if Chriſt have ſo loved us as to give himſelfe for us, how ought we to love Chriſt, and to love one another for his ſake? This is the heart, as a man would ſay, whereby we do give entertainment unto Ieſus Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16098:199"/>whereby we doe embrace him within us: and ſurely whoſoever can come to this, that our hearts be ſeaſoned with a love to God, and to Chriſt, and to our brethren for his ſake, out of queſtion the Lord Ieſus Chriſt dwells in us, and lives in us, and we dwell and live in him.</p>
            <p>The fourth grace is Obedience, even obedience to the whole will of God; here comes in the whole duty of a Chriſtian, as well repentance as new obedience. This is a grace ſpecially reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the death of Ieſus Chriſt; Ieſus Chriſt he was perfectly obedient in his death; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are that have our hearts rightly ſeaſoned with the death of Chriſt, why ſurely it will worke a conſcionable obedience to the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, to be ſorrowfull for our ſins paſt, to deny our ſelves, to mortifie the luſts of the fleſh, to dye to ſinne, theſe be the naturall effects of the death of Chriſt in the hearts of beleevers, theſe we muſt bring with us, to bee conformable to the whole wil of God, as Chriſt was in his life, and ſpecially at his death. <hi>I am come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to doe thy will O God:</hi> and thus doth the death of Chriſt frame the hearts of every one of us to true obedience: I am content to doe thy will O God; this is as it were even the practiſing of the death of Chriſt crucified, namely, in our obedience to God, denying our owne ſelves, in mortifying our owne ſinfull luſts and affections; for wee muſt know that theſe meditations muſt not be dead meditations, but ſuch as muſt be lively and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to quicken us up to obedience to Gods wil.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:16098:200"/>
            <p>The laſt grace is Thankfulneſſe, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all honour and thankes to be due unto God for this great worke of our Redemption by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, this is a chiefe grace that we muſt chiefly bring with us to the Lords Supper, to give God the praiſe and glory of it: and this is our rejoycing in the death of Ieſus Chriſt: it is not poſſible that a man ſhould know Chriſt Ieſus, or that a man ſhould love Chriſt for his death, or that he ſhould obey Chriſt, but he muſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the death of Chriſt: and how ſhould wee rejoyce in the Lord, but by giving him thanks, and ſinging of praiſe to him for this great benefit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one muſt bring theſe graces in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or elſe hee is not fit to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper: Now if ſo bee the Lord ſhould come among us, and make an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and rip up every one of us, alas how ſhould he finde every one of us to be empty of theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe full of imperfections in every one of them: well, yet though we have failings, ſtill let us labour for theſe graces, let us pray to God for theſe graces, and let us never doubt if we do pray and labour for them conſcionably, but that firſt God will give us in ſome meaſure every one of them; ſecondly, if wee come with a true deſire, God will graciouſly accept of our deſire, as if we had poſſeſſion of the graces themſelves: but the chiefeſt matter is this, that that which wee have, and that which we want of theſe graces, the Lord will ſupply them all out of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, who is full of grace and truth, and of whoſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16098:200"/>we all receive grace for grace, therefore let us ſeeke for theſe graces, and labour for them, and uſe the meanes, and let us put our ſelves to the mercy and leaſure of God, and let us not doubt but that the Lord will be mercifull unto us, and he will give them us ſo farre forth as ſhall ſuffice for the ſaving of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Another matter of inſtruction is this; this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us what it is that wee muſt eſpecially looke after when wee come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that which is ſpecially tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, the death of Chriſt. I ſhewed you firſt there muſt be hungring and thirſting; and ſecondly, what graces we muſt bring with us; now what is the chiefe matter that we muſt ayme at? the very death of Ieſus Chriſt, to diſcerne it: and here we muſt inlarge our thoughts to many conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Firſt and for moſt we muſt conſider with our ſelves that Chriſt dyed for us, that he ſuffered a ſhamefull and a cruell death; then when we have conſidered of that, we muſt conſider that Chriſts death is a ſufficient ranſome for mans redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I, but I muſt goe further, and ſay that I am one of the perſons that ſhed Chriſts blood, thogh it were the Iewes act, yet it was my ſinne: and then further, that that blood which I have ſpilt, the ſame ſhall bee effectuall through Gods rich mercy, for the ſaving of my ſoule: and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I muſt tye my ſelfe to obey the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and to be made like unto it, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable thereunto.</p>
            <p>The laſt Vſe: It ſhould teach us what is the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16098:201"/>ſtraine, the higheſt ſtraine, the higheſt pitch that a man ſhould reach at in the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Wee muſt ſo diſcerne the death of Chriſt in the Sacrament, that we may bee made partakers of Chriſts death: Firſt, to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of it with an holy admiration and a fervent meditation thereupon: and ſecondly, to be more and more incorporate into it by a holy kinde of union: thirdly and laſtly, to be ſaved by it, as by the all-ſufficient price of our redemption. Firſt, we muſt come to meditate, and ſo to partake of it, as that we be ſwallowed up with the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the death of Ieſus Chriſt; the death of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a bottomleſſe depth, man cannot reach it, the Angels cannot reach it, and wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend it, and therefore the beſt way is, when we have conſidered all the occurrences of it that we can, let us lay our ſelves wholly into the hands of God, to be ſwallowed up with that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditation of the death of Chriſt, and to bee comprehended of that which wee are not able to comprehend. Secondly, to bee more and more incorporated into it by a holy kind of union, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that is a true beleever, that is converted unto God, is already incorporated into Chriſt his death; ſo then when we come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, we muſt partake the death of Chriſt, ſo, as that we may be the more incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into it, that is, to be made more and more one with Chriſt in his death, than ever we were before, more crucified and more mortified than ever wee were before; there is no way whereby
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16098:201"/>we can have part in Chriſt but by union, and there is no way whereby we can have unio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Chriſt, but by being incorporate into him by the power of his death; and there is no better way to make us more incorporate into the death of Chriſt, than the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is; and therefore when we come to this, let this be our ſtraine, not onely to bee ſwallowed up with the meditation of the death of Chriſt, but labour to be more and more incorporate into the death of Chriſt thereby.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, let us ſo labour to bee made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it, that we may be ſaved by it, as being the all-ſufficient price of our Redemption, for by the death of Ieſus Chriſt the wrath of God is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Law of God is fulfilled, there the Iuſtice of God is ſatisfied, for there our ſinnes are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there our ranſome is payd, there is all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed whatſoever is neceſſary for the ſalvation of mankinde, and therefore as at all times, ſo then eſpecially when we come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, let us labour to be ſo made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Lords death, &amp; of that infinite benefit that ariſeth by it, that wee may be ſaved by it, as by the all-ſufficient price of our Redemption.</p>

               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:16098:206"/>now we made repetition of that which was laſt ſpoken concerning this caution, namely, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the death of Ieſus Chriſt. Now as God ſhall inable us, we are to handle the manner: the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how this death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the Sacrament, is a ſhewing forth, ſaith the Text, a ſetting forth, or a ſhewing forth, for ſo the words ſignifie, that is to ſay, a kinde of lively and ſenſible expreſſing of the death of Chriſt, is in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, one tranſlation comes a little ſhort of the power of the word in the originall, which is worthy to be knowne; we read it hence we ſhew the Lords death, the originall word intends two things very materiall to our preſent purpoſe, for it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the ſimple verbe it ſelfe is very ſignificant, but the prepoſition that it is compounded withall, addes ſomewhat more to the ſignificancy of it, and makes it more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and more full to the matter wee have in hand. Firſt, the ſimple verbe it ſelfe ſignifies to ſhew, to publiſh, or to declare, not ſimply, but to ſhew and publiſh by way of a meſſage, or as it were by way of a lively voice. In the Sacrament of the Lords Supper there muſt be certaine ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and certaine words that are to be uſed, there is a meſſage that is to bee publiſhed whenſoever the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. If you aske what that meſſage is: I anſwer, it is the very meſſage of the Goſpell, the very doctrine of the Goſpell, free remiſſion of our ſinnes by the blood of Chriſt; that is the ſubſtance
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16098:206"/>of the Sacrament, that is the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: and our Saviour himſelfe when he did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Sacrament, as it is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. there he ſaith, <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament that is ſhed for many for the remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> Here is the very preaching of the Goſpell, publiſhed in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, free remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt. And ſurely the very ſame word that ſignifies the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in the originall, is derived from this ſimple verbe that here is uſed; giving us ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the meſſage that is to bee publiſhed is indeed the meſſage of the Goſpell. Why then in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper Chriſt muſt be publiſhed by way of meſſage, or by way of lively voice: But ſecondly, the prepoſition that it is compounded withall, that addes ſomewhat more: what is that? It muſt be done throughly, it muſt be done earneſtly, for ſo the word ſignifies in the Originall: as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e would ſay, there muſt be a vehement publiſhing of it, a vehement ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth: It is not onely a ſhewing that will ſerve the turne, much leſſe a ſlender and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhewing of the death of Chriſt; but it muſt be ſhewed throughly and earneſtly: as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe is a matter of great waight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ever was, ſo likewiſe the ſhewing forth muſt be anſwerable thereunto: It muſt be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt ſeriouſly and moſt affectionately; and this the word ſignifies in the originall. Yee ſhew forth the Lords death by way of a meſſage, and that earneſtly, till he come. And whereas ſome
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16098:207"/>reade it poſitively by way of approbation, <hi>You doe ſhew the Lords death till he come;</hi> and others doe reade it imparatively by way of command, <hi>See ye ſhew the Lords death;</hi> or, <hi>You ſhall ſhew the Lords death;</hi> both theſe in ſubſtance tend to one and the ſame effect. And indeed the one of theſe doth conſequently inferre the other: For if wee reade it poſitively, <hi>Yee doe ſhew the Lords death,</hi> then this being a matter that is commended in them by the Apoſtle; it doth imply that it is a duty, and muſt be performed: then if we reade it imparatively, <hi>(Ye ſhall ſhew)</hi> or, <hi>(See you ſhew the Lords death till he come,)</hi> then it is implyed that all the faithfull that will conforme themſelves to the ordinance of God, they doe performe this, they practiſe this at the receiving of the Sacrament, <hi>they doe ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> If we reade it poſitively, it intends thus much, namely, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a fit occaſion, or a fit meanes, in and whereby we come to <hi>ſhew forth the Lords death:</hi> If we reade it impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, <hi>ye ſhall ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a duty, (that whenſoever we meet together at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, we muſt be ſhewing forth of the Lords death;) there is little difference betweene them, and in effect they are the ſame: and becauſe I am loth to vary from our own tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but upon good occaſion, &amp; becauſe our tranſlation comes neereſt to the originall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the originall doth naturally ſound to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>you doe ſhew the Lords death,</hi> rather than <hi>yee ſhall ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> therefore I will not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16098:207"/>change our owne tranſlation, but take it poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is propounded, <hi>that you doe ſhew forth the Lords deathtill he come:</hi> ſo we will take it, that the Sacrament is a fit ſubject or meanes in and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew forth the Lords death: and this is the principall matter that this Scripture doth ayme at, and this doth confirme directly the very point that we made choice of this Scripture for, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to prove that the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is a memoriall of the death of Chriſt: The Text ſaith plainly, <hi>As often as ye eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till hee come;</hi> or remember, or expreſſe in a lively man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Lords death.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label> The Doctrine then that here we are to obſerve for our inſtruction, is this, In that the Apoſtle ſaith here, Whenſoever you receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ye ſhew forth the Lords death: Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper being rightly adminiſtred and received according to Gods owne ordinance, is a freſh and a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly memoriall, a ſenſible repreſentation, a through ſetting forth, or a through ſhewing forth of the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: I ſay if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received and adminiſtred according to Gods owne ordinance, for ſo the Apoſtle meanes here: for having in the 23, 24, and 25 verſes reformed the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, according to our Saviours firſt inſtitution, thence he gives them this Item, <hi>As often as yee eate this bread, and drinke this cup, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, that if it be rightly adminiſtred, and inſtituted, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16098:208"/>according to Gods owne ordinance, then it is a lively repreſentation, and a right ſhewing forth of the Lords death. Conſider the whole frame and inſtitution of this Sacrament made by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour both for matter of circumſtance, and for matter of ſubſtance: you ſhall ſee that both of them doe confirme this truth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for matter of circumſtance: there bee three circumſtances that may be alledged to this purpoſe. One, is the time of this inſtitution, the night when he was betrayed: another, is the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that this inſtitution did inſue upon: and the third is the cariage of our Saviour immediately before he inſtituted it.</p>
            <p>Firſt for the time: the time when he inſtituted it, when was it? the night that hee was betrayed; as it is in the 23 verſe: the Apoſtle doth not note the time, but upon very juſt occaſion. Marke it, over-night our Saviour inſtituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, for the expreſſing of his death; the next day our Saviour ſuffered that death which was in and by that Sacrament to be expreſſed. How could our Saviour deviſe to have ſerved himſelfe better upon the advantage of the time, to make the Sacrament to be a freſh and a lively repreſentation and memoriall of his death, than by reſpiting the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſo neare as neare might bee to the time of his death: the one was done over-night, and the other the next day.</p>
            <p>We know that ſuch things as have ſome neare dependance one upon another in nature, looke
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16098:208"/>how more neerly they are performed in time, ſo much the more doth the one give the better help to the remembrance of the other; whereas if one be done long before the other, they will not meet ſo readily and freſhly in our memories: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the eating of the Paſſeover, which was a type and memoriall of the deliverance of the Iſraelites out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was of purpoſe reſpited to the night before their departure (they were to eate the Paſſeover over-night, and the next day to depart) that whenſoever afterward they were to eate the Paſſeover, it might renew upon them a more freſh memory of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they had had the Paſſeover a yeare or two before, and a yeare or two after beene delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then there would not have beene ſuch a joynt concurrence of them together in their minds, the Paſſeover would not have been ſuch a palpable and preſent memoriall of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as it was: ſo likewiſe Ieſus Chriſt hee inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Sacrament of the Lords Supper over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, he ſuffered his death the next day, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever after, we come to receive the ſacrament of the Lords Supper, the time wherein his death was ſuffered following ſo preſently upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sacrament, the one of theſe might helpe forward the other, that ſo the Sacrament might bee the more lively remembrance of his death, the circumſtance of the time of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſo neare the time of his death, proves unto us that Chriſt had a full intent to make the Sacrament a freſh memoriall of his death.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:16098:209"/>
            <p>The ſecond is the action that this inſtitution did enſue upon, what was that? why that was the eating of the Paſſeover, as appeareth in the 14. of <hi>Marke</hi> 22. <hi>And as they did eate, Ieſus took the bread, and when he had given thankes, he brake it, and gave it to them, and ſaid, Take, eate: this is my body, &amp;c.</hi> They were then eating of the Paſſeover, ſo ſaith the Text, as they were eating, <hi>Chriſt tooke the bread and gave it to his Diſciples, &amp;c.</hi> The Paſſeover it ſelfe was as I have ſhewed you heretofore, a Type and a memoriall of the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but principally of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſinne and Sathan by the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and yet notwithſtanding immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eating of this Paſſeover did our Saviour Chriſt inſtitute the ſacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as if our Saviour ſhould ſay unto them, well; now you have eaten the Paſſeover; this Paſſeover did not onely ſignifie your deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but principally your deliverance from ſin and Sathan by my death; for indeed I am that true Lambe of God, ſlaine and eaten, and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Paſſeover; but yet howſoever that did ſignifie my death unto you, yet it was but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what darkly and obſcure, you could not be ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of my death by that; but now I will give you a Sacrament that ſhall expreſſe my death, and your deliverance moſt cleerly, and that is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper. The very ſtraine of the ſtory in <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke, &amp;c.</hi> being well conſidered, doth afford us this collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That our Saviour preſently after the eating
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16098:209"/>of the Paſſeover, did inſtitute the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as if that were not cleere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but this ſhould bee moſt cleere for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the cariage of our Saviour immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the inſtitution of the Sacrament, as it is in the 13. of <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. to 22. wee ſhall finde there that our Saviour did teach unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples many good leſſons, he taught them humilitie, and charity, both by example, and by doctrine: moreover, then he did foretell them of his death, and told them covertly who ſhould betray him: he quoted a place of Scripture for it: and all this was done upon the inſtant of the inſtitution; his teaching them humility and charity, his foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them of his death, his putting them in minde of theſe things, and raiſing them up to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his ſufferings before-hand; all theſe concurre together by way of circumſtance, to teach that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a manifeſt ſhewing forth of the death of Chriſt, &amp; the uſe therof: for Chriſts own humbleneſs and love which then hee ſhewed by his practice, are matters of ſpeciall note in the death of Chriſt: and our humbleneſſe and love, which then hee taught us, both by his doctrine and example, are ſpeciall fruits and uſes of his death in us. Now to the ſubſtance of it, whether we reſpect: the ſignes uſed in the Sacrament, or the actions, or the words in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the ſignes; the very ſignes they ſhew forth the death of the Lord; the bread
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16098:210"/>ſhewes forth the body of Ieſus Chriſt, expreſſing it lively, the bread is a ſollide ſubſtance, ſo is the body of Chriſt; the bread is the food of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the ſtrengthening of our hearts, the ſtaffe of our life in the ſtate of nature; here is a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to ſpirituall minded men, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is the ſpirituall food of our ſoules, the ſtrength of the hidden man of our hearts, it is the ſtaffe of the life of God in the ſtate of grace to every true beleever; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the wine ſhewes forth the blood of Chriſt, the Wine is a liquid ſubſtance, ſo is the blood of Chriſt, but principally the ſweetneſſe of the ſmell of the wine, the pleaſantneſſe of the taſte of the wine, the comfortable cheerfulneſſe of the wine, whereby it doth glad our hearts, this is a moſt lively expreſſing unto us of the blood of Chriſt Ieſus, this ſhewes unto a ſpirituall minded man, if this wine be ſo ſweet and pleaſant, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, oh what a ſweet ſavour hath the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, oh what a pleaſant reliſh is there in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, oh, what comfort and cheerfulneſſe is there in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt to every diſtreſſed and beleeving ſoule, that can finde and feele theſe things within himſelfe; this they doe ſingle, each by it ſelfe: now put both theſe together (as both of them are tendred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to us in the Sacrament) then here is a full refreſhing ſet forth unto us: that there is a full refreſhing to every beleeving ſoule in the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: ſo much for the ſignes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the actions in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16098:210"/>both on our Saviours part, and likewiſe on our our part: on our Saviours part, he tooke the bread and brake it; what is that to ſay, but as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, Doe you ſee mee breake this bread, thus, thus is my body broken for you; ſo for the cup: when hee tooke the bread and brake it, he diſtributed and gave it among them; here is a manifeſt ſhewing forth of the extenſion of the death of Chriſt, that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is the common Saviour of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. He tooke the bread ſaith the Text, and hee gave it unto them; and ſo of the cup. Then againe here is an action on our part, as our Saviour bid them to take it, ſo wee doe take it, wee take the bread, we eate it; we take the cup, wee drinke it; what is this but a ſhewing forth of the death of the Lord, except our hands belye our hearts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be otherwiſe then we ſeeme to be, when we take the bread and eate it, when wee take the wine and drink it, we openly profeſſe that wee are of the number of them that take hold on Ieſus Chriſt, and doe apply him particularly to the comfort of our owne ſoules.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the words of inſtitution in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the words, what are they? why firſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the Text ſaith, <hi>He tooke the bread and brake it,</hi> and bid them to take and eate; here you ſee firſt he bids us to take it, to ſhew us hee intended that his body is ours, and that his death is a ſacrifice to God for us, whereby our ſins are ſatisfied for, and whereby we are reconciled to God; then he ſaith, <hi>This is my body:</hi> he ſpeakes demonſtratively, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16098:211"/>he ſpeakes it by way of an eſſentiall predication; he ſaith, <hi>this is my body;</hi> as if our Saviour ſhould ſay to every ſpirituall minded man and woman, This Sacrament is as lively a repreſentation of my death, as if my body and blood were here cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and ſhed before your eyes: and ſo likewiſe it followes, <hi>this is my body which is given for you, and my blood which is ſhed for you for the remiſsion of ſins:</hi> here is a full ſhewing forth of the Lords death, here is the Goſpell preached at the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament, that the blood of Ieſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all our ſinnes. It followes in the laſt place, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my death, for ſo the Apoſtle expounds it, hee had repeated our Saviours words in the verſe going before, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> and he comes and expounds it here, Doe this in remembrance of my death; as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, conſider well, and adviſedly of this Sacrament, for this Sacrament is in it ſelfe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and a lively memoriall of my death, and ſo you muſt eſteeme of it, and ſo you muſt make uſe of it, and ſo to every beleever it ſhall be made good for all ſaving purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the doctrine is proved, both by the circumſtances, &amp; the ſubſtance, and the whole frame of the Sacrament, that the Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adminiſtred and received according to Gods own ordinance, is a freſh and a lively memoriall, a ſenſible repreſentation, a through ſetting forth of the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16098:211"/>reaſons of the doctrine are theſe:</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> The firſt reaſon is drawne from the nature of the Sacraments, the ſacraments are as it were glaſſes wherein we may ſee and behold the true forme, or the true ſhape, or the true likeneſſe of that which is repreſented in the glaſſe; a glaſſe muſt be both true and cleere, it muſt be true that it may not caſt a falſe ſhadow upon us: not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect another manner of ſhadow than is caſt upon it, it muſt bee cleere, that the true object that it doth repreſent, may be cleerly and lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us: the ſacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is a glaſſe, it muſt be a true glaſſe, and a cleere glaſſe, what is the object repreſented by it, the principall object of the Lords ſupper that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled unto us in it, is the death of Chriſt; then conſider, the object that is to be ſeene and beheld in this glaſſe, is the death of Chriſt: the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a glaſſe wherein this is to bee beheld, a glaſſe muſt be true and cleere, and therefore the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt cleerly and plainly, and lively ſhew forth the Lords death, which is the principall object there to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Againe, Sacraments wee know, are teaching ſignes; fignes ordained of God that they may bee teachers unto us: and teachers you know muſt ſpeake plainly, they muſt ſpeake teachably, they muſt deliver the matter with a lively voyce, ſo as it may be beſt knowne, diſcerned, and underſtood, and worke inſtruction in the hearts of thoſe that it is to be learned by; the Sacraments are teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16098:212"/>ſignes, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a teaching ſigne, the leſſon that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper teacheth, is the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt teach the death of Ieſus Chriſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and cleerly, and ſo muſt be a through ſhewing forth of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> A ſecond reaſon is drawne from the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word with the Sacrament, the word that ſhewes forth Chriſt lively vnto us, therefore the Sacrament that ſhewes forth the death of Chriſt lively to us too: that the word ſhewes forth the death of Chriſt lively, it appeares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Oh ye fooliſh Galathians, who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not beleeve the truth? to whom Chriſt Ieſus was before deſcribed in your ſight, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you crucified.</hi> The <hi>Galathians</hi> they never ſaw Chriſt crucified in their lives, but yet <hi>Paul</hi> did preach Chriſt crucified ſo plainly, and ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that he did as it were preſent Chriſt crucified before their bodily eyes, he did ſo worke by the operation of Gods ſpirit in his miniſtery, that they had a more ſure and plaine apprehenſion of the death of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, then many of thoſe that ſtood by and ſaw him crucified: if it be ſo in the word, it is ſo in the ſacrament: if the word do ſo lively repreſent him, the ſacrament doth it much more, for the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a viſible word, that is to ſay, looke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the word ſounds unto us in our eares, that the ſacrament preſents and exhibits before our eyes; the ſacrament is a viſible word, now that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16098:212"/>which I ſee to bee done before my face, is more lively repreſented unto mee, than that which I heare with my eares, therefore if the Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the death of Chriſt lively, then doth the Sacrament much more.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> The third Reaſon is drawne from the end of the inſtitution. What was the end of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament? what purpoſe had our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when he inſtituted the Sacrament? Even this purpoſe chiefly, that he might leave among his Diſciples to the end of the world, a pledge, a token, and pawne, as the memoriall of his death that he ſuffered for us: the end that Chriſt aymes at he will not have fruſtrate: that which Chriſt doth, he will doe it throughly. If hee come to ſet fire upon the earth, what is his will but it ſhould burne? If Chriſt ordaine a memoriall of his death, it ſhall be a cleare memoriall; this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ordained of purpoſe by him for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> ſaith hee; therefore it is a lively repreſentation of his death: and except wee will impeach either the power, or the goodneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, as who ſhould ſay, he could not make a lively repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his death, or elſe he would not, we muſt needs confeſſe that this Sacrament is as lively a memoriall of his death as ever could be deviſed. I might adde other reaſons, as namely, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of the New Teſtament. The ſtate of the new Teſtament requires that all things ſhould be moſt cleare, and moſt plaine, and eſpecially the death of Chriſt, that that ſhould be moſt clearly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16098:213"/>repreſented unto us. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10 <hi>I will poure forth my Spirit upon the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, and I will make them that they ſhall looke upon me whom they have pierced:</hi> that is, behold me as it were with their bodily eyes. Now the meaning is, that hee ſhall deale with them to this effect by his Spirit: but yet collaterally it reaches alſo to the Word and Sacraments: for if he doe deale with them ſo by his inward Spirit, then the outward meanes muſt bee anſwerable: ſo then, the reach of the place is to teach us that in the time of the Goſpell Chriſt Ieſus ſhall be repreſented before our eyes, and this ſhall bee by the Spirit of God in our hearts; but ſtill it muſt bee underſtood that the Word and Sacraments muſt be anſwerable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and therefore the Word and Sacraments muſt repreſent Chriſt Ieſus unto us, as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if hee were nailed upon the Croſſe before our eyes.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> The Vſes of the Doctrine are theſe: The firſt Vſe is this; Firſt, here is matter of inſtruction, calling upon us for many good duties, that the conſideration of this doctrine ſhould raiſe us up to performe. Is it ſo, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is ſuch a lively repreſentation, ſuch a freſh memoriall of the death of Ieſus Chriſt? then this ſhould teach us, that our private and publike preparation before wee come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper; I ſay our publike, but eſpecially our private preparation, ſhould be ſuch as may bee anſwerable unto that buſineſſe that we have in hand: and ſeeing when we come
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16098:213"/>to the Lords Table wee come to behold Chriſt here before us, as it were with our bodily eyes, in the outward ſignes, and with the eyes of our mindes, under and within thoſe veiles: therefore every one of us muſt labour ſo to be fitted, and ſo prepared before we come hither, that we may be worthy and profitable beholders of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and worthy receivers of the myſteries and benefits of his precious death: Take this for your rule, and remember it well, and let this bee prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, if not in the ſame kinde, yet in the like; whenſoever wee have a purpoſe to come to the Lords Table, let us ſtill have our hearts medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon Chriſts death all the weeke long, but eſpecially over-night, and that morning that we are to receive, let us labour carefully to endue, and informe our ſelves with the thoughts of the death of Ieſus Chriſt. How ſhould that be? why reade ſome good booke of that argument, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reade the Booke of all Bookes, I mean the Booke of God: if thou canſt not reade, get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reade it to thee: read the 53. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> there we may ſee how lively he ſets before us the death of Chriſt, long before Chriſt himſelfe felt the ſmart of it: and ſo proceed to reade the ſtory of his death in one of the Euangeliſts, as <hi>Matthew, Marke, Luke,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> as all are very pregnant for that purpoſe: and we know, that howſoever there bee ſome men that have ſet forth this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very worthily, yet all of them come farre ſhort of one line of the Holy Ghoſt: one chapter in the Booke of God being well underſtood, ſhall
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16098:214"/>doe us more good, being ſeriouſly meditated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than all other Books beſides. I ſay, reade the Chapters of the ſtory of the death of Chriſt, and as thou readeſt them, take them to heart, and pauſe deliberately upon them, and conſider of them well, and pray to God to imprint the ſame into thy heart by the finger of his Spirit; and if thus thou doeſt from one Communion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou ſhalt finde through Gods bleſſing, that whenſoever thou commeſt to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, thou ſhalt there ſee thy Saviour moſt clearly: but if thou be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thus to meditate of Chriſt before-hand, thou ſhalt be but an unprofitable receiver, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe myſteries. I will make the matter ſomewhat cleare by a compariſon. If there were a Martyr to ſuffer for the profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, two men (having knowne him before) goe together to ſee his death; the one of them knows him but a little, and hath heard of the cauſe only in ſome generall termes, but the other hath more neere acquaintance with him, and hath better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelfe of him, and was by when he was arraigned, and heard his arraignment, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, and all the paſſages of the buſineſſe, and what was alledged againſt him by his accuſers, and what he anſwered for himſelfe, and why the ſentence of death was paſſed againſt him: which of theſe two men ſhall be moſt affected with the death of this Martyr? Out of queſtion hee that was ſo lately acquainted with his arraignment, and his inditement, and with the whole cauſe of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16098:214"/>his death; the death of that Martyr ſhall ſtrike much into this mans heart, and worke ſoundly upon him; whereas the other man which knew of him but in generall, ſhall bee moved with it but little or nothing at all: So it is in this caſe; when wee come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, wee come to behold Ieſus Chriſt executed and put to death to every ſpirituall receiver, in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner; to reade the ſtory concerning the death of Chriſt, &amp; to meditate upon thoſe things conſcionably and religiouſly, with a deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them; it is as if ſo bee a man ſhould have ſtood by when Chriſt was arraigned and indited, and heard what was ſpoken againſt him, and what ſentence was paſſed upon him. For when the Holy Ghoſt pennes a ſtory he will pen it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if we lay downe our hearts to be wrought upon by the power of the Word, wee ſhall finde ſuch a powerfull working by it, that it ſhall bee more effectuall to us than it wee had beene there preſent to have ſeene the death of Chriſt. So then by reading the ſtory before-hand, wee being as it were preſent with him at his arraignment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, thinke with your ſelves whether this will not be a notable meanes to make the death of Ieſus Chriſt effectual unto us in the Sacrament, and if we looke for any benefit by the Sacrament, let us come with this preparation before-hand. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.19. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I tell you theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that when ye ſee theſe things come to paſſe ye might beleeve.</hi> He ſpeakes there partly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his death: the words that Chriſt ſpake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16098:215"/>his owne death, hee puts upon his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before-hand, that when it did come to paſſe they might beleeve; this would bee a meanes to cheriſh faith in them, and to make them beleeve it the better: ſo if wee come to the Sacrament, reade the Word of God, that part of the Word that principally concernes the death of Chriſt, and meditate upon that which Chriſt hath told us of before-hand, that ſo we might beleeve it, and this will bee a notable meanes through Gods bleſſing to make us that we ſhall beleeve that the death of Chriſt is ours, and that it is effectuall for our redemption.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Vſe for inſtruction, is this: Is it ſo, that the Sacrament is ſuch a lively repreſentation of the death of Chriſt, then this teacheth us, that the publike cariage of the whole buſineſſe of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt be framed and faſhioned ſo as it may make moſt for the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetting forth of the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and herein are many duties required of us. The firſt duty of all is this: the Word is to be preached, that ſo the people may underſtand and know that which belongs to God, and to their owne ſalvation, elſe it will bee but a blinde Sacrament: but eſpecially the Goſpell; the voice of the Goſpell, namely, the free remiſſion of ſins by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, that is to be preſſed upon them againe and againe, that they may be ſtirred up in their affections to eſteeme and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it graciouſly: it is a courſe that God hath uſed in all Sacraments, ſtill to joyne together
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16098:215"/>with the Sacraments the Word preached: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſacrament of Circumciſion was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, the Word was taught: ſo likewiſe the Paſſeover, as is cleare in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.35. It is noted there, that when their children ſhould come to aske what was this Paſſeover; Tell them, ſaith God, that this is the memoriall of the great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of their fathers many hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the bondage of Aegypt. So likewiſe Chriſt ſaith in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt, Matth</hi> 28. He doth not ſay, Goe and baptize, and let teaching alone; but, <hi>Goe teach;</hi> there is the ground and foundation; and then he builds upon it the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacrament, <hi>Goe teach, and baptize in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> If teaching be not joyned with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is but a dumbe ſacrament: if men ſhould come here to the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, and be not taught what it meanes, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it: it ſhould be with them as it was with the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.15. <hi>That ſaw Manna like Coriander ſeed;</hi> the Text ſaith, they knew not what it was, but when <hi>Moſes</hi> came and ſaid, <hi>This is the bread that God gave them from heaven:</hi> now they come to reliſh it. So when we come to this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and ſee the bread and the wine, except we be indued with the knowledge of Chriſt, and we underſtand Chriſt and him crucified, &amp; know the nature of the ſacrament, wee ſhall not know what to make of it: but if the Word be preached,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16098:216"/>then we beginne to grow to ſome underſtanding, and ſome life in the buſineſſe: and to reliſh this Sacrament as the ſpirituall Manna, the heavenly food of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the word muſt be preached, ſo likewiſe confeſſion of Faith ought to made. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally here amongſt us, wee make confeſſion of our Faith by the tendring of our bodies, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the confeſſion of our faith ought to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed before the receiving of the Lords ſupper; this is a right ſhewing forth of the Lords death. Marke it, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>yee ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> hee ſpeakes not to the Miniſters onely, but to the people, <hi>yee ſhew forth:</hi> therfore they ſhould make ſome publike confeſſion that they beleeve in Chriſt Ieſus. And this is a matter that tends much to the ſetting forth of the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Prayers are to be made: for therein likewiſe wee ſhew the death of Ieſus Chriſt. Firſt, there muſt be confeſſion of our ſins, and wee muſt ſearch into our hearts, and lives, narrowly, and throughly; and the more we ſearch into them, the more clearely we ſhall ſee Chriſt his death.</p>
            <p>Together with confeſsion of ſinnes, wee muſt uſe ſupplication and petition, calling earneſtly upon God, for Chriſt his ſake, which thus was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for us, that hee would forgive us our ſinnes in his blood: and this will give great light to the ſetting forth of the death of Chriſt, and then alſo thankeſgiving muſt be given to the Lord, we muſt thanke and praiſe God that it hath pleaſed him ſo to ſet his love upon us, as to give his Sonne to die
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16098:216"/>for us curſed and miſerable ſinners as we are, and to ſave us by condemning him. Fourthly, there is another duty required, the words of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt neceſſarily bee rehearſed, and this is a matter that gives wonderfull light to the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the ſacrament, for when wee heare the miniſter make rehearſall of the ſame words of Chriſt, then wee doe eſteeme highly of the ſacrament, as if Chriſt were perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally among us, ſpeaking to us with his owne mouth, and delivering his body and blood unto us, as it were with his owne hands; this is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes to ſet forth the death of Chriſt. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a Chriſtian duty and a needfull duty about the time of the ſacrament, to ſhew forth both our thankfulneſſe and our cheerfulneſſe, even by ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalmes.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, there is no Pſalme amiſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all were penned by the holy Ghoſt, yet ſome are more fit and ſeaſonable then others; the fitteſt Pſalmes are either teaching Pſalmes, or pſalmes of thankſgiving: if wee will have Pſalmes of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, there is ſpecially the 103 Pſalme, and the 116, full of good meditations to this purpoſe; but if we will have teaching Pſalmes, teaching us the death of Chriſt, for that is then moſt ſeaſonable, that teacheth us the matter of the death of Chriſt, then take the ſecond Pſalme, for that teacheth us concerning the death of Chriſt, as it is applyed by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.25. and ſo the 22 Pſalm, as it is alleaged 27 of <hi>Matth.</hi> for there are three ſeverall places quoted out of that Pſalme, ſingled
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16098:217"/>out, applyed expreſly unto the death of Chriſt; and therfore they are moſt ſeaſonable to be uſed, and it is neceſſary that wee make choice of the moſt ſeaſonable Pſalmes that are fitteſt for that purpoſe.</p>

               </label> Another uſe is matter of reprooſe of the Popiſh Church; many things in the Popiſh Church are hereby reproved. I will but touch them, that they doe directly oppoſe themſelves againſt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the truth, and tenure of it directly; whereas here the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>as often as you eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come;</hi> the Popiſh Church doth flatly croſſe this rule, divers waies:</p>
            <p>Firſt, in their halfe Communions, they have the bread, but not the cup, is this to ſhew forth the Lords death? no, it is but to ſhew forth halfe the Lords death, this is horrible wrong to the people, and diſgrace to the Sacrament, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God; hath God given us a great light to ſee Chriſt by, and ſhall men ſcantle it to halfe a light? hath God given us both the bread and the wine to diſcerne the Lords body and blood by, and to ſhew forth the Lords death by; and ſhall we have the body, and not the blood? ſhall wee have but one halfe, and bee deprived of the other? Againe, many times in the Popiſh Church they have their Maſſes as they call them, without any preaching at all, many times, and uſually it is ſo with them. I cannot ſay that by this they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that very maſſe of theirs from being a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; I will not ſtand upon it, but yet I ſay
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16098:217"/>that practice of theirs is a wicked and a graceleſſe practice, directly againſt this doctrine of God, <hi>you ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> how ſhould it bee ſhewed forth but by preaching and teaching? but they have little or no preaching or teaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; but chiefly the words of inſtitution they are to bee rehearſed: oh, but ſay they, wee have theſe words of inſtitution rehearſed, and therefore you cannot but ſay, that we have teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I anſwer, though they have the words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, yet the Prieſt mumbles them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the people heare him not. Secondly, if they doe heare him, it is in an unknowne tongue, they underſtand him not. Thirdly, when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſes them, hee turnes his face from the people, as of purpoſe to ſuppreſſe the right ſhewing forth of the Lords death; and therefore this practice of theirs ſhewes that they wold not have the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcerne the Lords death in this Sacrament; Theſe are fearfull abominations, and this lyes heavy upon thoſe people of God that live under Antichriſt: and therefore wee ſhould with great thankfulneſſe injoy and uſe theſe bleſſings that God hath beſtowed upon us, in the cleere exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the death of Ieſus Chriſt in the Lords Supper. I but ſay the Papiſts we ſhew forth the Lords death more then you, for wee lift up the Hoſt: is this to ſhew forth the Lords death? no, this is to ſhew forth their owne Idoll, their owne breaden-God that themſelves have made.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we are to proceed as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires for our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Sacrament the next ſabbath, in the handling of that Scripture which wee have made choiſe of out of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and the 26. <hi>verſ. For as often as ye ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, yee ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> We have ſhewed you the two generall parts of this Scripture an action to bee performed in the former part, the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that this action is to bee performed withall in the latter part of the verſe, the remembrance, or the ſhewing forth of the Lords death til he come; we have handled the firſt part of the verſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have entred into the ſecond part, where we ſhewed, that there is firſt to bee conſidered the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16098:219"/>caution it ſelfe, the ſhewing forth of the Lords death. Secondly, the frequenting of this action, or the often uſing of this caution to bee ſupplyed out of the former part of the verſe, <hi>as often as yee eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup:</hi> for that particle <hi>often,</hi> ſerves indifferently for the whole verſe, as well for the former as the latter part, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, as often as yee eate this bread and drinke this cup, ſo often ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come. Thirdly, we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you here the continuance of the obſervation of this caution, how long it muſt be kept, why till Chriſt Ieſus come to judgement, to the end of the world. The caution it ſelfe, the ſhewing forth of the Lords death, of that I have ſpoken already; now therefore wee are God willing, as the Lord ſhall inable us, to ſpeake of the ſecond thing, namely the frequenting, or the often uſing of this caution, the often ſhewing forth or remembring of the Lords death, <hi>as often as ye eate this bread and drinke this cup,</hi> ſo often <hi>ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come:</hi> which words we muſt not ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as if ſo bee that the remembrance or the ſhewing forth of the Lords death were preciſely confined and limited to the uſe of the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper; as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, that then onely the death of Chriſt is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred when the Sacrament is to bee received and not elſe, that is not the meaning, but we muſt take the words to be ſpoken with implication of a further exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this duty, namely, that therfore ſo often as we receive this Sacrament, wee muſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16098:219"/>remember and ſhew forth the Lords death after a ſpeciall manner, that thereby we may bee fitted and inabled to remember the Lords death, at all other times both by preparation before, and by continuall meditation after: for thus wee are to conceive of the preſent buſineſſe, the death of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt muſt never be out of the minds of thoſe that doe beleeve in him, their hearts muſt becon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually running upon the thoughts of him and of his death; now becauſe all of us are dull of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, dead and cold in affection, weake in memory, that either wee doe not underſtand the death of CHRIST, or not affect the death of CHRIST, or not remember the death of CHRIST as wee ought, therefore the Lord hath appointed the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, as a principall meanes to releeve us in this caſe. In that ſacrament the Lord teacheth us the death of Chriſt, that we may underſtand it; in that ſacrament the Lord expreſſeth the death of Chriſt unto us lively that we may be affected with it; in that ſacrament likewiſe the Lord tenders unto us the death of Chriſt, that ſo wee may the better retaine the memoriall of it, and that it may ſticke the faſter and the cloſer by us, not onely for that preſent time whileſt we are receiving, but alſo for all times afterwards, for as it is in our bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, we eate and drinke at ſome one ſet time or other, as namely, at dinner, or at ſupper, not that our bodies ſhould bee refreſhed and comforted then onely for the preſent whileſt wee are eating, but becauſe by that ſtrength which then wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16098:220"/>our bodies might alſo bee refreſhed and comforted afterwards when we are to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the duties of our calling, ſo likewiſe in our ſpirituall repaſt, we ſanctifie the ſabbath &amp; keepe it holy unto the Lord, we doe not keepe the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath holy, becauſe we would bee holy onely upon the ſabbath, but becauſe that that holineſſe which wee attaine unto by meeting God in his owne ſaving ordinances upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſabbath day, that the ſame holineſſe might ſeaſon us and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us, and continue with us, and thrive in our hearts all the weeke following, and all our lives follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo likewiſe it is in this particular in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the death of Chriſt is remembred and ſhewed forth very lively and very freſhly, not that wee ſhould be indued with the thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the death of Chriſt onely for the preſent whileſt we are receiving, but that thereby wee might be brought to make it to be our continuall meditation alwaies after; and this as it is implyed in this ſecond clauſe, <hi>ſo often as yee ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ſo often yee ſhall ſhew forth the Lords death:</hi> ſo it is further and more plainly inforced in the third clauſe, <hi>ſo often as yee eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ſo often yee ſhall ſhew forth the death of the Lord till he come,</hi> which injoynes the continuance of it; for it is as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Your remembrance, your lively and ſenſible remembring of the death of Chriſt in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, muſt not onely ſerve you for the preſent time, but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16098:220"/>it muſt frame and faſhion your minds to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of this grace, that is to ſay, to the continuall remembring of the death of Chriſt Ieſus, that you may make it your practice day and night, every day and every houre of your life; ſo it is with you ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> and not with you onely, but ſo it muſt be with all the faithfull, from age to age, till Ieſus Chriſt ſhall come to judgement. And this I take to be the right ſtraine of the Apoſtles ſpeech in this verſe, <hi>(ſo often as yee eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come)</hi> touching the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſts death ſimply in it ſelfe, yet with raiſing it from this ground, namely, from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts death in the participation of the ſacrament, the death of Chriſt is alwaies to be remembred in a lively manner in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacrament, that ſo it may be freſh in our memories at all other times ſo long as wee live.</p>

               </label> The doctrine that ariſeth is thus much, namely, that the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ought to be alwaies had in continuall remembrance of all thoſe that profeſſe his name, and embrace his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ye ſhew forth the Lords death as often as ye doe this; marke the words, the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt muſt alwaies be had in continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance by all thoſe that doe profeſſe his name, and embrace his Religion; for proofe of this doctrine, take that firſt which is in the 12 of <hi>Zach. v.</hi> 10. where God promiſeth <hi>to poure out his Spirit upon his people, the ſpirit of grace and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16098:221"/>and they ſhall looke on him, whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourne for him as one mourneth for his firſt borne, or his onely ſonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Scripture ſheweth the ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall practice of the faithfull, when once they are effectually converted unto God. God poures out his ſpirit of Grace and compaſſion into their hearts, and ſo converts them. And what doe they then? Then they doe ever after looke upon him, whom they have pierced, they have their eyes, and their mindes altogether fixed upon Chriſt pierced, upon Chriſt crucified, or upon Chriſts death. And this is no ſlender remembring, or no ſhort remembring of the death of Chriſt, but it is a very affectionate remembrance, and it is a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remembrance, it is an affectionate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, as being joyned with ſorrow and griefe, and much lamentation, as there the Text ſaith: And this ſorrow it is a laſting ſorrow, and ſo this remembrance a laſting remembrance; <hi>Hee ſhall mourne, as one ſorroweth for his firſt borne:</hi> A man that hath loſt his onely ſonne, mournes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and hee never forgets him; ſo they ſhall never forget the death of Chriſt. The ſenſe of the death of Chriſt is ſo foundly faſtned upon them by the Spirit in the act of their converſion, that it ſtickes deepe within them, and cleaves cloſe unto them; for ever after they make it their continuall meditation. The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. admoniſheth the <hi>Corinths</hi> that they ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and keepe in memory thoſe things that hee had preacht and delivered unto them, and that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16098:221"/>they had received, that is in the firſt and ſecond verſes: in the third verſe hee ſhewes what the things are that he delivered unto them, the death of Ieſus Chriſt. Why then, the death of Ieſus Chriſt muſt be continued in, as it muſt be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo it muſt be continued in, and it muſt bee kept in memorie. Marke the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there, <hi>whereby you are ſaved</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>if you continue and keepe in memory thoſe things, except yee have beleeved in vaine.</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, they that are ſaved by the death of Chriſt, they continue in the death of Chriſt, they keepe the death of Chriſt alwaies in memory, otherwiſe they beleeve in vaine, they profeſſe faith, but it is but a ſhew of faith, without this there is no true ſaving faith in them at all.</p>
            <p>In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. The Apoſtle chargeth <hi>Timothy Remember</hi> (ſaith hee;) What ſhould hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? <hi>that Chriſt Ieſus made of the ſeede of David, was raiſed againe from the dead, according to the Scripture.</hi> The Apoſtle covertly and joyntly under the name of Ieſus Chriſt his Reſurrection, preſſeth upon <hi>Timothy</hi> the remembrance of the death of Chriſt, <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Chriſt crucified.</hi> The Apoſtle had exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> before, that hee ſhould ſuffer affliction like a valiant ſouldier, that hee ſhould looke to his miniſtery, and fulfill that with a good conſcience: but whatſoever hee did, or whatſoever hee ſuffered, ſtill hee muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſts death, and his riſing againe from the dead. And ſee what a preparative the Apoſtle gives to <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Verſe going before, <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16098:222"/>what I ſay, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things.</hi> By that preparative that hee gives to <hi>Timothie</hi> in the ſeventh verſe, he would raiſe him up to a more ſerious remembring of the death of Chriſt in the eight verſe, as that being the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt duty of all other, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for example in this caſe, both in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and likewiſe in his practice; ſee it in his preaching, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I eſteeme to know nothing ſave Chriſt Ieſus, and him crucified:</hi> as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles heart and minde where wholy poſſeſſed, and wholy ſwallowed up with the thoughts of Chriſt crucified, or with the thoughts of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, that his tongue could runne upon nothing ſo readily as upon that; and ſo likewiſe in his practice: In the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Every where</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we beare about in our bodies the dying of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtles reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the death of CHRIST was not ſuch as ours commonly is, a bare contemplation of him, a bare thinking of his death, but it was ſuch as ours ſhould bee, a practicall feeling of it, a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall remembring of it, certaine ſenſible effects in his body by affliction, or by perſecution, ſtill minding him of the death of Chriſt; <hi>Wee beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in our bodies</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the dying of the Lord Ieſus;</hi> and this was not onely for a time, but it was continually ſo with them, ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where doe we beare about in us the dying of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> The word in the originall ſignifies altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is to ſay, at all times, and in all places; in all places whereſoever we come, ſtill <hi>wee beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

Now let us come to handle ſome Reaſons of it; the Reaſons of it are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> The firſt Reaſon is this: why muſt the death of Chriſt be had alwayes in continuall remembrance of thoſe that profeſſe his name, and embrace his Religion? Why, Chriſt himſelfe hee alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members us, ever did, ever doth, and ever will: and therefore ſhall not wee alwayes remember him? In <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.12. there you ſhall finde, how that the two Onyx ſtones, wherein were written the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were to be put upon the ſhoulders of <hi>Aarons</hi> Ephod, the Text ſaith, <hi>in remembrance of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Aaron</hi> did beare the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> alwayes in remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. That was a type and a ſhadow; here is the ſubſtance. Chriſt Ieſus is our <hi>Aaron,</hi> the true High-Prieſt there ſpoken of, that hath all the names of the faithfull written alwayes in his memory, and carries them alwayes as it were upon his ſhoulder, ſtill preſenting all his choſen before the Lord: Hee alwayes remembring us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring us in his whole life, remembring us ſpecially at his death, for then he paid deareſt for us, &amp; now that being gone away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us in regard of his bodily preſence, yet ſtill hee remembers us, and makes continuall interceſſion for us before the Lord: Shall our vile perſons being ſo grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16098:223"/>alwayes bee remembred by the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhall not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and his precious death bee alwayes and continually remembred by all of us? Hearken what the Spouſe ſaith in <hi>Cantic.</hi> 2.6. compared with <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.12. in <hi>Cantic.</hi> 2.6. the Spouſe there, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt her welbeloved, ſaith, that <hi>his left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me.</hi> Cantic. 1.12. <hi>My beloved is as a bundle of mirr he unto me, he ſhall lye betweene my breaſts.</hi> This Spouſe is every beleeving ſoule, every true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoule.</p>
            <p>When once we doe enter into a due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration how dearly we are beloved of our Huſband Chriſt, that hee layes his left hand under our heads, and embraceth us with his right hand; that he ſtill remembers us, and nouriſheth, and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth us, then doe we preſently fall into a holy reſolution, that ſurely wee will be kinde to him, ſeeing he is ſo kinde to us; and he being ſo kinde to us, as alwaies to cheriſh us, and remember us, therefore we will remember him, he ſhal reſt and lie betweene our breaſts, we will alwayes make his death our continuall meditation and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. If an ordinary man ſhould die for us, that we by his death might eſcape, and bee acquitted from death, would not our hearts in common and naturall kindneſſe evermore be running upon this mans death? Surely it would: Why then, ſeeing the Lord IESVS CHIST hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed himſelfe in our ſtead, and dyed for us, and by his death hath acquitted us from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16098:223"/>that death which wee ſhould have ſuffered; why ſhould not our hearts and mindes bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes running upon him, and upon his death? Some may ſay, May I not remember Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right though I remember not his death. I anſwer, thou canſt not remember Chriſt, except thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his death, for hee hath purchaſed his Church by his death, and look what intereſt thou haſt in him, or he in thee, it is onely by the death of Chriſt, and therefore thou canſt not remember him ſavingly, without thou remember his death, and have it graven within thy heart. Can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forget her Child that ſhe hath travelled for, and endured ſo much paine for? Can the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt forget us, that hath endured ſo much paine for us, farre greater then the travell of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? No, it is impoſſible; Chriſt Ieſus cannot forget us at any time; therefore ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus ever did remember us, and ever doth, and ever will, and it is impoſſible that hee ſhould at any time forget us; this ſhould, and muſt perſwade us to make the death of Ieſus Chriſt our continuall remembrance.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> Secondly, God alwayes remembers the death of Chriſt; it is our duty, and it is our grace, and our happineſſe to doe as God doth, therefore ſeeing that God remembers Chriſts death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, oh, how ought we to remember Chriſts death alwayes too? It is true, God cannot bee ſaid properly to remember any thing, becauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance is of things paſt, nothing is paſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, all things are ſtill preſent before,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16098:224"/>him; neither can he be ſaid properly to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one thing more then another, becauſe hee cannot forget any thing. But yet to ſpeake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of man, God may be ſaid, and God is ſaid to remember things done, yea, ſome things more then others; becauſe he teſtifies and ſhewes by his outward proceedings more reſpect unto ſome things, then unto other; thus may God be ſaid to remember the death of Chriſt, and that more, and above all things elſe, becauſe he ſhewes in his outward proceedings more reſpect to the death of CHRIST, then to any thing elſe. Whatſoever God doth in the adminiſtration of the world, he doth it reſpectively to the death of Chriſt; let it be to the preſervation and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faithfull: It is reſpectively to the death of Chriſt, becauſe they have their parts in him, and he in them. Let it bee to the deſtruction of the wicked, it is reſpectively to the death of Chriſt, they have no part in Chriſt: whatſoever dangers thou eſcapeſt, thou eſcapeſt them by the power of the death of Ieſus Chriſt: whatſoever benefits thou receiveſt, it is by vertue of the death of Chriſt: whatſoever grace God giveth thee, he giveth it thee only in the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of the death of Chriſt: whatſoever ſinne God forgiveth thee, he forgiveth it thee meerly in the ſhedding of Chriſts blood. Is the death of Chriſt ſo precious, that it is worthy alwayes to bee remembred by the Lord himſelfe, how much more then is it to be remembred by us?</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> A third reaſon; we have continuall need, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16098:224"/>continuall uſe of the death of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt have it alwayes in continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, we muſt alwayes have it in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe about us; we have continuall need and uſe of the death of Chriſt, great need, as much as our bodies, and our lives, yea, as much as our ſoules are worth; our faith that requires daily to be ſtrengthened: why, our faith that is ſtabliſhed in the blood and death of Chriſt, ſo the Scripture ſpeaketh, <hi>Through faith in his blood;</hi> as the blood of Chriſt, or the death of Chriſt, being the very chiefe foundation that the faith of Gods children is rooted in, and ſetled, and ſtabliſhed upon: wee muſt pray continually; every body knowes that it is the expreſſe commandement of the Apoſtle, <hi>Pray continually;</hi> we can never put up any the leaſt pleaſing petition to God, but the eye of our faith muſt be fixed upon the death of Chriſt, and therefore we muſt alwayes remember it; wee are tempted daily to ſinne, no ſound reſiſtance of any temptation but in the death of Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10, 11. <hi>If we ever overcome the accuſer, it muſt be by the blood of the Lambe;</hi> ſin muſt be mortified, the death of Chriſt is the onely ſword to mortifie and to ſlay ſinne within us. And laſt of all, we ſin dayly and therefore we have need of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes, and reconciliation, and peace to be made with God continually; no hope of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and of reconciliation, but onely and meerly by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt; now ordinary wiſedome and reaſon teacheth us, looke what we know wee have continuall uſe of,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16098:225"/>whereſoever wee goe, wee will bee ſure to carry that about us, be it money, or ſtrong waters, or the like, wee will alwayes have it about us: wee have continuall uſe and great need of the death of Chriſt, even as much as the price of our life and ſoule is worth, therefore let us alwaies have that in our hearts, alwaies in a readineſſe about us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have continuall uſe of it.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>4</label> A fourth reaſon is this, the death of Chriſt Ieſus doth alwaies labor for us, and worke for us, as a man would ſay, and travels for us, and that not in any ſmall employment, but in the beſt and the greateſt worke that concernes our beſt good, namely, in ſatisfying our debts, and in making our peace with God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. the Apoſtle ſaith there, <hi>that the blood of Chriſt Ieſus that ſpeakes better things, then that of Abel;</hi> the intendment of that Scripture is this, wee ſinne daily againſt God, the ſinnes that we doe commit, doe cry out daily to heaven for vengeance to be poured upon us, even as the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did cry for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to bee poured upon <hi>Cain,</hi> but the blood of Chriſt Ieſus that ſteps in for us, and that ſpeakes better things than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> and calls to God for mercy and for forgiveneſſe, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes againſt the cry of our ſinnes, and procures mercy and forgiveneſſe at the hands of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, <hi>verſ.</hi> there the Apoſtle calls the blood of Chriſt the new, and the freſh, and the living Way. Well, what is the meaning of it? the meaning is this, that whereas wee doe ſinne and offend God daily, the blood of Chriſt Ieſus that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16098:225"/>daily makes our peace; the death of Chriſt, that is as it were day by day freſh and bleeding anew in the ſight of God, and ſo makes our peace with God. It is true indeed when Chriſt offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon the Croſſe, that then his blood was actually ſhed and never elſe, yet it is as true that the blood of Chriſt bleedeth anew effectually in the ſight of God, when any ſinne is forgiven any ſoule. The death of Chriſt thus working and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling for us, ſhal not we remember it continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? We muſt never forget thoſe that worke and labour for us, and for our good, and ſhall wee not alwaies remember CHRIST IESVS, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his death, whereby hee doth effect our greateſt good.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>5</label> The laſt reaſon is this, the thoughts of the death of Chriſt Ieſus are moſt ſutable and agreeable unto us in this preſent eſtate that we are in, and therefore wee ought to remember it alwaies, ſo long as we are in this eſtate; the thoughts of his reſurrection they are alwaies comprehended within the thoughts of his death, and the thoughts of Chriſt his glory (that being a matter which we can ſee here onely a farre off) are not ſo fit for us in this abaſement and humiliation, and corrupt eſtate we are now in, continually to feed upon; but the thoughts of the death of Ieſus Chriſt are moſt fitting for this preſent eſtate. In this eſtate we are daily to bee caſt downe before the Lord, nothing will humble us ſo throughly as the thoughts of the death of Ieſus Chriſt; ſtill wee muſt have ſinne to be crucified, mortified and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16098:226"/>within us: In this ſtate of humiliation that we are in, there is nothing ſo powerfull and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to kill ſinne as the death of Ieſus Chriſt; in this ſtate we muſt be fitted ſtill and prepared to the glory that ſhall be revealed; the thoughts of the death of Ieſus Chriſt continually medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon, are an excellent preparation for us to glory; for if we remember the death of Chriſt affectionately as we ought, wee ſuffer with him, and therefore we ſhall be ſure to raigne with him; wee are dead with him, and therefore alſo ſhall live with him: theſe thoughts being ſo ſutable and agreeable to our preſent eſtate, therefore the remembrance of Chriſts death muſt alwaies bee preſent with us.</p>
            <p>The uſes of the doctrine are theſe, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> the firſt uſe is this; here is matter of reproofe: this ſerves then to reprove two ſorts of people; Firſt, it ſerves to reprove the prophane and carnall graceleſſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world, that will never enter into any ſerious thoughts of the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; if ſo be that to blaſpheme Chriſts death, &amp; to blaſpheme Chriſts blood, to make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it in their fearfull oathes, &amp; damnable proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if that be to remember Chriſts death, they remember it often enough, oftner then they are able to juſtifie: but as for any holy, religious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent, devout, and ſaving remembrance of Chriſts death, that they never enter into: no, they ſeek all the means they can, &amp; take all the courſes that ever they can to turne ſuch thoughts out of their hearts, ſuch thoughts are too ſad and too
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16098:226"/>ſorrowfull for them, they cannot endure them: take a man that lies wholy in his ſinne, hee had as lieve thinke upon hell, as upon the death of Ieſus Chriſt ſoundly and ſeriouſly as he ought to doe: but let ſuch graceleſſe wretches know, that for this they ſhall never bee had in remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord for any mercy, becauſe they doe not remember the death of Chriſt, wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone mercy is tendered to mankind.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it ſerves to reprove ſome of our nice and ſluggiſh profeſſors, that content themſelves now and then with the thoughts of the death of Ieſus Chriſt; happily when they come to the Lords Table, happily when any affliction or croſs or extremity comes upon them, when they have any pang, or torment of conſcience comes unto them for their ſinnes, then happily they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the remembrance and the thoughts of Chriſts death, but they cannot endure to make it their continuall taske, which is the duty here preſt upon us: theſe men muſt know that God doth not love to be ſerved by ſpirts and fits, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we doe in the ſervice of God, let us doe it ſoundly and conſtantly; God cannot endure ſuch ſervice as theirs is, God requires intire obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we ſhould obey him in all our courſes, and that at all times, eſpecially when juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any duty is offered unto us. Now then ſeeing juſt occaſion is daily offered, that wee ſhould alwaies bee meditating, and our hearts running upon the death of Ieſus Chriſt, therefore God requires it at our hands, that wee ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16098:227"/>remember it, this fire ſhould never go out of our hearts, it muſt glow and burne within us night and day: It is fit that Gods children ſhould have ſome ſet time when they ſhould enter into a ſerious meditation of the death of Chriſt, and yet not to thinke our ſelves acquitted, if we doe it onely then: but that that ſhould prepare us to remember it ever after, as we ſhewed before in our bodily repaſt.</p>
            <p>A ſecond uſe of this doctrine is this; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> here is matter of tryall for us, whereby wee may know our ſelves whether we be in the right way, or no; whether we doe truly profeſſe the faith of Chriſt as we ought to doe: all of us profeſſe Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wee know wee can have no part in Chriſt except we have part in the death of Chriſt; and we know we can have no part in his death, except it be remembred of us, and applyed unto us in our continuall meditation, therefore let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this, that ſo many of us as profeſſe religion, if wee doe not apply the death of Chriſt to our ſelves from time to time by due meditation; whatſoever wee profeſſe, ſurely wee profeſſe in vaine, and this will be a witneſſe againſt us, that we are not the true children of God: if ſo be that you would learne how you might come to know whether you have the right remembrance of the death of Ieſus Chriſt within you, learne it by theſe two or three markes, ſee it: in the morning when you awake, doe you finde your hearts ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with good thoughts of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, with thoughts concerning forgiveneſſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16098:227"/>and mortification and reconciliation to GOD: and likewiſe if you have theſe thoughts or the like at night when you goe to bed, this is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine evidence that your ſoules are ſeaſoned with the death of Ieſus Chriſt; againe, when we are in the duties of our calling, all the day long we muſt ſtill have our hearts lifted up and ſetled upon the death of Chriſt; and our thoughts muſt be run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon our juſtification, and our ſanctification, and our conformity to the death of Chriſt; yea in our very mirth, we muſt ſtill preferre <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> when we are in our greateſt mirth, in our honeſt recreations (for thoſe that are unhoneſt there is no hope of any ſpirituall comfort in them) but in our honeſt recreations; doe we prefere the death Ieſus Chriſt before all thoſe things that wee for a while doe ſolace our ſelves withall, eſpecially in the uſe of the meanes of ſalvation, in the hearing of the Word, &amp; the receiving of the Sacrament? When we come to heare the Word, do we finde in our ſelves a deſire to be drawn on to ſee Chriſt crucified before our eyes? When wee come to the receiving of the Sacrament, is it our chiefe practice to remember Chriſt crucified affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and to have our hearts throughly ſeaſoned with the power of his death? theſe bee undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſignes and aſſurances unto us that wee have our part in the death of Chriſt.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> A third uſe is matter of exhortation for us Miniſters, teaching us that we ſhould ſtill labour to ſprinkle all our ſpeeches private and publike, with ſome matter concerning the death of Chriſt,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16098:228"/>with ſome matter concerning Chriſt crucified, it was almoſt the whole doctrine of the Apoſtle, ſtill to preach Chriſt crucified, but the uſe doth concerne all both Miniſters and people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſhould ſtirre up every one of us both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people, that we ſhould labour to make the thoughts and the remembrance of the death of Chriſt, to be ordinary with us, to bee familiar with us, ſtill make that as familiar with us as ever poſſibly we can: in all our courſes let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the death of Chriſt; if wee remember that ſoundly, then it ſhall goe well with us, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver befals us: that we may bee the better inabled, and the more quickned to the performance of this duty; Firſt, I will give you a taſte of the meanes whereby wee may attaine to make the death of Chriſt ſo familiar to us; and then I will ſhew the benefits that we ſhall receive hereby, if we conſcionably travell in this courſe. The means of it are theſe in few words: If we would have the death of Chriſt familiar unto us, we muſt be ſure that we doe never paſſe it over with a ſleight me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, but let it be ſoundly taken to heart; doe not thinke upon it as an ordinary common thing: but conceive of it as a matter that doth concerne us, and our good moſt of all: let us thinke upon the death of Chriſt in that which he ſuffered and endured in his ſoule and body for our ſinnes, how hard it went with him in the Garden when hee ſweat water and blood, when his ſoule was heavy even unto death: and how much more harder it went with him when hee was upon the Croſſe,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16098:228"/>when he ſaid, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> That he that was in ſingular favour with God, ſhould be made the very marke of Gods wrath to light upon; that he who was the worlds Redeemer, ſhould bee expoſed to the obloquy and reproch of the whole world; that he who was the Lord of heaven and earth, ſhould be now in the hands of the powers of darkneſſe, wee ſhould yearne in our very bowels, and be much troubled in our inmoſt affections at the thoughts of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt be frequent in the uſe of the meanes, in the hearing of the Word, in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, and prayer, for by this meanes, wee ſhall make this death of Chriſt our owne; there God tenders unto us the death of Chriſt, let us come thither with hearts deſirous, ready and willing to receive it, and there we ſhall be ſure to have it. Let it be our reach in all theſe duties to have an eye upon the death of Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeking to have that ſoundly fixed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened upon us, whatſoever we faile in elſe, ſtill let that above all other ſticke moſt cloſe to us. Then againe wee muſt labour to worke the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſts death into our affections, this is the right memory of heavenly things; when the heart affects them, the heart will ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which it doth much affect: When I ſee any thing that cauſeth deepe affection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, either much ſorrow, or much joy, or the like; I will remember that ſoundly, then let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to worke the remembrance of the death of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16098:229"/>Chriſt into our affections; let it ſtill worke love in us becauſe Chriſt loved us to die for us, and let it worke hatred in us againſt ſinne, becauſe it was ſinne that brought him to his death; and let it worke ſorrow in us, that he ſhould bee ſo cruelly murthered and put to death for us.</p>
            <p>And let it worke rejoycing in us, that wee for our parts by his death are ſaved, and by his ſtripes are healed: Let the death of Chriſt worke theſe affections in us, and then it ſhall be our owne, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to forget it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let us put our ſelves to the power, and the rule, and the directions of it, let us ſuffer our ſelves to be ſwayed by the death of Ieſus Chriſt, in all our courſes, let it beare rule with us, the counſell that our Saviour gives in the like caſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any doe my will, the ſame ſhall know my doctrine;</hi> any Chriſtian that labours to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any duty, the beſt way to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, is to labour for the obedience to that duty; ſo if wee would remember Chriſt his death, then let us labour to ſubmit our ſelves to the power and obedience of it.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever we doe, let us examine it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be agreeable to the death of Chriſt, if it be not, then to ſay with our ſelves, wee will not doe it though we may gaine all the world by it: theſe are the meanes whereby wee may attaine to the habit of this grace, namely, to the continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of the death of Chriſt Ieſus, a ſaving remembrance.</p>
            <p>The other point is the benefits that hereby will
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16098:229"/>ariſe unto us. If wee remember continually the death of Chriſt in our hearts, we ſhall have many and great bleſſings. The firſt bleſſing is this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> By this means we ſhall have a Book alwayes ready in our boſome, alwaies a book about us to teach us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian duty; for the death of Ieſus Chriſt is ſuch a Booke that will inſtruct us in every duty that belongs unto us. To give you an inſtance in two or three: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Would you learne humility and meekneſſe? looke into the death of Chriſt; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 2.5, 6. that ſhall be ſufficient to teach you hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and meekneſſe, and obedience. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Would you learne patience? the death of Chriſt is a book to teach you patience: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Looke to the author and finiſher of your faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame, &amp;c.</hi> conſider him therefore that yee faint not. Would you learne love to the brethren? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt his death teacheth you this duty in the higheſt degree: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>If Chriſt ſo loved us, that he laid downe his life for us, then how ought wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to lay downe our lives for the brethren.</hi> Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to deny our ſelves is a ſpeciall leſſon that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are to learne; this is effectually taught us by the death of Chriſt: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered in the fleſh, that we ſhould not live to our ſelves but to him;</hi> and this is a lively teacher: if the death of Ieſus Chriſt be ſoundly layd up in thy heart, it will both teach thee the duties to bee performed, and alſo inable thee to performe them.</p>
            <p>A ſecond benefit is this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thou ſhalt have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull peace, and unſpeakable comfort from God
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16098:230"/>by this meanes. Our ſinnes they accuſe us, our conſciences they accuſe us, the devill hee accuſeth us daily before the Lord; O but if thou have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the death of Chriſt in thy heart, there is a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> for them all; that pacifies and appeaſeth them all, and that is a generall releaſe and acquittance from all that ever they can charge thee withall.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we ſhall have much ſpirituall growth and increaſe by the word and the Sacrament, and much ſpirituall growth if once our hearts be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the death of Chriſt. What doth the word and the ſacrament teach, but the death of Chriſt? that is the ſubſtance of them all. Then if once the death of Chriſt be grafted in thy heart before, Oh, with what comfort and chearfulneſſe, and with what great profit ſhalt thou heare the word, and receive the ſacrament? When our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke hath ſome liking to our meate, and our meate hath ſome affinitie to our ſtomacke, then there is a quicke digeſture. Why ſo if ſo bee our hearts be ſeaſoned with the death of Chriſt, why then when wee come to heare the word and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, there will be a ſweet digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and battening in the inner man. Indeede the whole worke of the Spirit it is done meerly in the power of the death of Chriſt Ieſus. Gods Spirit doth nothing in the heart of any man or woman for the matter of ſalvation, but it is done all in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the death of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it will be a notable bridle to thee from ſinne, an excellent meanes to reſtraine thee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16098:230"/>from ſin; that howſoever thy corruption drawes thee on, and Sathan hee tempts thee, and the world that allures thee, the fleſh that provokes thee; How ſhouldeſt thou ſtand againſt all theſe enemies? Oh, if thou have the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and the remembrance of it ſoundly in thy heart, then all theſe ſpeakers to thee, they ſhall ſpeake unto thee as to a ſtone-wall, to a deafe man. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. The Apoſtle faith there, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing ſave onely in Chriſt, and him crucified, whereby the world is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to mee, and I unto the world.</hi> Let the whole world ſet upon me to tempt me, yet it ſhall not prevaile: for the whole world is crucified to me, and I unto the whole world, by the Croſſe of Chriſt; I am as a dead man unto the world. A man that hath the death of Chriſt ſoundly ſeated in his heart, hee cannot wittingly and willingly ſinne againſt God. Indeed, this light may be, and is ſometime darkened in us by the miſt of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temptation, and then we may be, and are oft-times over-taken with ſinne: but ſo long as this light is cleare within us, ſinne ſhall never bee able to overcome us. There is ſuch a ſtrong ſtay againſt ſinne, in the ſerious thoughts of the death of Chriſt, that ſo long as that theſe are within us, ſinne cannot prevaile againſt us.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fift benefit is this, it will furniſh us, and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to the dutie of prayer, that we ſhall come to God at all times humbly, and yet chearfully too; humbly, alwayes acknowledging and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing our ſinnes, and mourning that we are the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16098:231"/>parties that have crucified the Lord of life and of glory: and yet cheerfully, as reſting upon the merits and death of Ieſus Chriſt for our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. And howſoever it be that we finde many infirmities and imperfections in our prayers, and thinke with our ſelves that therefore God will not heare us, yet let us comfort our ſelues in the remembrance of the death of Chriſt: this being in thy heart and conſcience, be of good cheare, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt hee makes continuall interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for thee, and hee takes thy prayers and puts them up, and preſents them unto God in thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe in his owne name, and ſo makes thy prayers acceptable before the Lord.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The laſt benefit is this: this ſhould be a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meanes to make us fit and ready to die; to worke in us an earneſt looking for and haſtning of the day of Chriſt. Hee that hath the death of Chriſt ſoundly ſeated in his heart, hee is fit and ready to die. For firſt, by this practice, by the continuall remembrance of the death of Chriſt, we alwayes looke death as it were in the face, and being every day and every houre ſo well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, we are not afraid of it when it comes. Againe, hereby, by the remembrance and ſound meditation of the death of Chriſt, wee dye daily, as the Apoſtle ſaith, our ſinnes die in us, and our luſts die in us, and our affections and rebellions dye in us; and ſo wee are halfe dead already, that ſo when death comes to take hold upon us, it hath not ſo much to doe with us, as with other men. Take this for a certaine truth, that a man
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16098:231"/>of mortification, who hath his heart broken for ſinne, and that hath his luſts, and affections, and rebellions in ſome good meaſure mortified and crucified within him: I ſay, death is nothing ſo tedious and irkſome to ſuch a man, as it is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Wee ſee this by experience in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and the two theeves that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. The manner of their death was thus; They were to bee crucified and nailed upon the Croſſe, and then to hang till they dead: wee cannot ſay of any one thing, that it ſhould give them their deaths wound; but the cuſtome was, that when they were crucified they ſhould have their legs broken, thereby to make an end of them: the Text ſaith, <hi>that they came to the theeves, and brake their legs;</hi> but when they came to our Saviour Chriſt they brake not his, for he was dead already; he had none of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, none of thoſe reſiſting luſts within him to ſtrive againſt the ordinance of God as the other had, but he did ſweetly yeeld up the ghoſt in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto God, and therefore Death had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with him ſo much as with the other. So likewiſe wee finde it with men of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by this remembrance of the death of Chriſt continually, we ſee all the evills and all the harmes of our death taken away in his death, and ſo there is no cauſe to us to feare it at all.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, wee ſee by this that Chriſt himſelfe who is our Lord, and Maſter, and Head, hee hath undergone this before us, and therefore wee are
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16098:232"/>content in a holy reſolution to undergoe that which he hath done: ſhall the members fare bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Head? No ſurely.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and laſtly, by the continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the death of Chriſt, we ſee and behold that it was a full and finall end of all his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that thereby he entred into glory: wee conſider from thence, as it was with him ſo it ſhal be with us; when death comes it ſhall put an end to all trouble and affliction; and the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſhould quicken us up to deſire death, to deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt. O beloved, when a man comes to lye upon his deaths bed he would give all that he had to be fitted for death, and to be ſure of comfort. Oh let us make the death of Chriſt therefore our continuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: and this is that which will yeeld us ſuch a gracious preparation for our death, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world ſhall doe the like beſides; and therefore let theſe conſiderations ſtirre us up to a reverent and conſcionable performance of this duty of the remembrance of the death of Chriſt Ieſus; ſo much good, and ſo many benefits as are to be reaped by it, why ſurely we are utter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our owne good, if we doe not travell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably in the faithfull practice of this duty; let not the difficulty of this duty in it ſelfe, let not the diſtaſtfulneſſe of it to fleſh and blood, nor the loſſe of carnall pleaſure and worldly profit, nor let not the harſh cenſure of the graceleſſe people of the world, nor let not the bent of our naturall life which is utterly againſt it, make it unpleaſant
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16098:232"/>to us, let none of theſe, nor all theſe hinder us from being ſet upon this duty, but let us breake through them all in an holy zeale, and ſet our ſelves ſoundly to meditate upon the death of Chriſt, in hope of theſe heavenly bleſſings, that the meditation of this duty will bring us unto, therefore ſtill remember the death of Chriſt, and as ever thou deſireſt to have a living teacher with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, remember the death of Chriſt; as ever thou lookeſt to have comfort from God, ſo look that thou remember the death of Chriſt; as ever thou lookeſt to have ſpirituall growth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by the Word and Sacraments, ſtill looke to the death of Chriſt; as ever thou lookeſt to have a ſtrong bridle to reſtraine thee from ſinne, ſo ſtill let the death of Chriſt bee thy continuall meditation; as ever thou deſireſt to come before God cheerfully and with comfort in prayer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the death of Chriſt; as ever thou deſireſt to be fitted and prepared to dye, remember the death of Ieſus Chriſt; as ever thou deſireſt and loveſt any one or all theſe bleſſings together, remember the death of Chriſt, and that continually, let it never goe out of thy minde.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE purposing God willing the next Sabbath to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; we are therefore according to our ordinary courſe, to make preparation thereunto by this Sabbaths evening Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, that ſo we may come with better grace in our hearts to that heavenly Table.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as yee ſhall eate this bread and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> Which Scripture containes as you have heard theſe two parts, an action to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the former part of the verſe, the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, <hi>as often as ye eate this bread, and drinke this cup.</hi> Secondly, a caution that this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16098:234"/>action is to be performed withall, in the laſt part of the verſe, the remembrance, or the ſhewing forth of the Lords death till he come. We have fully finiſhed the former part, and through Gods mercy we have proceeded in the handling of the latter part, to the laſt clauſe of all, <hi>till he come: ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> I ſhewed you that this latter part of the verſe containes the caution, that the receiving of the Sacrament is to be performed withall, it miniſters unto us theſe things to be conſidered of; Firſt, the caution it ſelfe, namely, the ſhewing forth of the LORDS death; wherein wee ſhewed you what it was that was to be remembred, the death of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and alſo the manner of the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, by a ſhewing forth, or by a ſetting forth, by a lively or a ſenſible expreſſing of it. Secondly, it doth commend unto us the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this caution, that the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt muſt be often reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, for though that particle <hi>often</hi> bee onely named in the former part of the verſe, yet by all common underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is alſo to be underſtood in the latter part of the verſe, As often as ye doe receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo often yee remember the Lords death. Thirdly and laſtly, here is the continuance of this caution, the continuance of this duty, take it ſo, how long is it to continue? why, till he come, ſo long as the world ſtandeth: till Ieſus Chriſt ſhall come to judgement. So then, here we are now come to the laſt clauſe of all, containing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this duty, let this be done til he come,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16098:234"/>till Chriſt come to judgement; in which clauſe there be two things offered to our conſideration, the firſt is the continuance of this duty it ſelfe; and that is directly and expreſly affirmed, <hi>ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> That this duty muſt be continually, and muſt never ceaſe to continue in the Church ſo long as the world ſtands. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing is covertly implyed, yet plaine enough too, if the words be well weighed and conſidered, and that is the end or the reach that wee muſt ayme at in the performance of this duty, namely, the fitting and the preparing of us to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt unto judgment, for ſo the very ſame particle <hi>(till)</hi> is uſed in the very ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p>In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. where it is ſaid that Chriſt <hi>muſt raigne till hee have put all his enemies under his feet; till he have put all his enemies,</hi> the meaning of it is this; Firſt, that Chriſts reigning ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall till the very end of the world. Secondly, and the end of Chriſts reigning is this, the utter deſtruction of his enemies, and the trampling of them under his feet, ſo it is in this caſe, Doe this duty till he come, that is to ſay, this duty muſt be continued till Chriſt come to judgement: and the end and the reach that we muſt ayme at in the performance of this duty is, that we be fitted and prepared for his comming. We cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this clauſe clearly and fully except we take it with theſe two explications; the firſt is this, that howſoever this duty is impoſed by name up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Corinthians</hi> onely, <hi>yee ſhew the Lords death
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16098:235"/>till he come:</hi> yet notwithſtanding it is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably implied to all the faithfull by ſucceſſion, from time to time to the end of the world: for the Apoſtle knew very well that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in themſelves in their owne perſons ſhould not live till Chriſt ſhould come to judgement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was impoſſible that they ſhould keepe this commandement <hi>till he come:</hi> but the Apoſtle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> this duty for their time, that they muſt obſerve it ſo long as they live; and likewiſe impoſeth the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the ſucceeding Churches, from age to age to the worlds end, that they muſt obſerve this duty ſo too: ſo that is the firſt explication; the ſecond explication is this, that howſoever this clauſe be here expreſly referred onely to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verſe, to the caution, to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts death, Ye remember Chriſts death till he come; yet it is implyed and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to belong alſo unto the former part of the verſe, to the action it ſelfe, the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. For as that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of frequenting the word often is uſed onely in the former part, yet it extends it ſelfe in ſenſe to the latter: ſo this clauſe of continuing till hee come, though it bee named onely in the latter part, yet in ſenſe it doth extend it ſelfe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verſe; ſo that both the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Lords death, and alſo the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, both theſe are to bee continued till Ieſus Chriſt ſhall come to judgement, for ſo the Apoſtle here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16098:235"/>pounding our Saviours meaning in the words go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, when he ſaith, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> he addes this rule of continuance, doe it <hi>till he come:</hi> now each of theſe were joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by our Saviour Chriſt, namely, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Lords death; and likewiſe the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, therefore each of theſe muſt alſo be implyed together by the Apoſtle. Concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall remembrance of the death of Chriſt wee have ſpoken the laſt day, where we handled the frequenting of it; now therefore wee come to ſpeake concerning the continuance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper to the end of the world, which is the firſt point, that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and expreſly affirmed.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> The doctrine that hence ariſeth for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is this, namely, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a perpetuall ordinance of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to bee duely and continually obſerved by all the faithfull from time to time to the end of the world; this place you ſee affirmes it plainly, Doe it till he come: and I doe not know any one Scripture beſides, that doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and particularly confirme this point unto us, not particularly I ſay concerning this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but yet there be many Scriptures that may be alleadged that doe prove this doctrine by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence, and that very cleerly and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſufficiently in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.13. there is a parable, A Noble man went into a farre Country to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Kingdome for himſelſe, and ſo to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16098:236"/>he calleth his ten ſervants &amp; giveth them ten pieces of mony, ſaying, Trade you till I come. The Nobleman that there is ſpoken of in the parable, is our Saviour Chriſt, he went into a far country to receive a Kingdome for himſelfe in heaven, and ſo to come again at the day of judgment. By the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants there we are to underſtand chiefly Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as they being particularly employed about the holy things of God, the Word and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch like, wherby the Lord is eſpecially ſerved &amp; worſhipped. By the pieces of mony that there are given unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we are to underſtand all ſuch gifts which the Lord Ieſus doth beſtow upon his Miniſters, for the preaching of the Word, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and for the diſcharge of the whole worke of their Miniſtery, theſe gifts &amp; theſe indowments of theirs, muſt all theſe ſervants employ &amp; trade thriftily till Chriſt come, that is to ſay, till Chriſt doe come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That it is meant of the day of judgment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly out of <hi>v.</hi> 15. becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>when he did come againe and called his ſervants to account;</hi> now the day of accompt is the day of judgement. Then you ſee here, the gifts of their miniſtery, the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their miniſtery, the exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, they muſt continue untill Chriſts coming to judgment, their labors and their endeavours in their miniſtery, they muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue til Chriſt come to judgement. Trade all theſe things till I come; therfore the holy things of God, the word and the Sacraments which they do thus trade and labor &amp; endeavor in; they alſo muſt be perpetual ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

But you will ſay, <hi>Timothy</hi> could obſerve it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than his owne time, and hee was not to live till Chriſt was to appeare in judgement, how could hee obſerve it till then? I, but the Apoſtle ſets forth the nature and the condition of theſe ſaving ordinances, the Word and the Sacraments and the worke of the miniſtery, namely, that they be perpetuall ordinances to be obſerved duly and conſcionably, without ſpot, and unrebukable ſo long as the world ſtandeth, til the appearing of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and therfore <hi>Timothy</hi> he for his time &amp; his part muſt look that he do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcionably obſerve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo long as he liveth; I, &amp; he muſt take order, &amp; do the beſt that in him lyeth that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Churches from age to age ſhall embrace theſe ſaving ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, until the very appearing of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. To prove the point yet more
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16098:237"/>ſpecially, for that is only more generall: to prove it more ſpecially <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Goe,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>teach all Nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and I will be with you alwayes to the end of the world.</hi> Here is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and here is a promiſe; a command that they on their parts ſhould teach them to obſerve all that Chriſt commanded them; a promiſe on his part, that he will be with them and aſſiſt them in the worke of their miniſtery to the end of the world: the command is, that they ſhould teach and baptize, and adminiſter the Sacrament; for though but one Sacrament bee there named, yet the other muſt bee proportionably underſtood, that they were to adminiſter the Sacraments both of Baptiſme, and alſo of the Lords Supper, accordingly as Churches ſhould bee planted for ever: and that which followes in the twentieth verſe, takes hold very directly upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, <hi>teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you;</hi> now you know that our Saviour commanded the Apoſtles in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> therefore they were to teach them to obſerve this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, and the people they were to obſerve and to follow it. But how long muſt that continue? looke into the promiſe, and that will tell you, it muſt continue alwayes to the end of the world: Chriſt promiſeth his aſſiſtance
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16098:237"/>and his bleſſing in theſe labours and endeavours of theirs, in their preaching and adminiſtring of the Sacraments, and in all theſe actions to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue alwayes, ſaith the Text, to the end of the world; therefore the Word and the Sacraments, the preaching of the Word, and the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments ſhall continue alwayes to the end of the world: Where this bleſſing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that it ſhall continue to the end of the world, this endeavour of theirs muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of the world too: ſo then you ſee the ſacrament and the adminiſtration of it, is a perpetuall ordinance: you ſee it ſo in ſpeciall; one place yet more in particular, and ſo I end. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. that which is the ground of this text, our Saviour in the inſtitution of the ſacrament, ſaith, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> here you ſee that our Saviour layeth a charge upon his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that they ſhould doe this; what? admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and receive the ſacrament in remembrance of Chriſt: well, ſhall wee thinke that our Saviour would have his Apoſtles that they onely ſhould remember Chriſt; or was it not our Saviours meaning that all the faithfull ſhould remember Chriſt to the end of the world? why ſurely it is the meaning of our Saviour that all the faithfull ſhould remember Chriſt from time to time to the end of the world, as well as the Apoſtles; and this is the Apoſtles reach in theſe words; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made rehearſall of our Saviours words in the 25 verſe, preſently he ſaith, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me;</hi> and then he addes againe, <hi>if ye doe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16098:238"/>this ye ſhew forth the Lords death till hee come:</hi> the Apoſtle builds this very doctrine upon this very exhortation, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> therefore the Apoſtle concludes, that the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ordinance, and muſt bee obſerved in the Church till his laſt comming to judgement; and therefore the Apoſtle did eſteeme the words of Chriſt a pregnant proofe of the continuance of this ſacrament, and he builds it plainly thereupon. So much ſhall ſuffice for proofe out of Scripture, now let us ſee what reaſons may be added for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light: the reaſons are many.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> The firſt Reaſon is drawne from comparing this with the Paſſeover; that was to laſt for ever: <hi>Exodus</hi> 12.14. <hi>This is a holy remembrance to you, a holy feaſt to be kept among you throughout all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ye ſhall keepe it a holy feaſt for ever;</hi> the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was ſo in the former Teſtament, therefore the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper muſt be ſo in the new Teſtament; that was to laſt for ever, and therefore this to laſt for ever. The grounds of the Reaſon are theſe two: Firſt, the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper anſwers to the Paſſeover; and indeed unto us it doth ſucceed in ſtead and in place unto the Paſſeover, as wee have ſhewed partly before, and God willing ſhall ſhew more hereafter. The Sacrament of the Lords ſupper anſwers to the Paſſeover; the Paſſeover was to laſt for ever, and therefore the ſacrament of the Lords Supper muſt laſt for ever too. The other ground of the reaſon is this, The Paſſeover was a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16098:238"/>Sacrament for the time of the Law, which was only a time of ſhadowes; the Goſpell is a time of ſubſtance; ſhall we ſay that the ſhadow ſhall bee ſerved with more durable things than the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is? except we ſhall ſay that the time of the Law was ſerved with more durable things than the time of the Goſpell, ſurely the Sacraments of the one muſt bee as durable as the other. And therefore ſeeing the Paſſeover is to be kept for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt be obſerved for ever too. And whereas the word <hi>for ever</hi> may admit of two good and holy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations; which way ſoever you take it, yet ſtill the force of this reaſon holds. If wee expound that <hi>for ever,</hi> in that ſigne, or in the type, that is to ſay, till Chriſt his firſt comming, or till Chriſts comming and ſuffering in the fleſh, for that is the <hi>for ever</hi> that uſually is ſpoken of concerning the Sacrifices and Sacraments of the former Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely, the comming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh, or Chriſts ſuffering in the fleſh; hee is the very terme and the very end of the Law, as the Apoſtle ſheweth in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.1. If ye take it I ſay, in this ſenſe, yet the force of the reaſon will neceſſarily follow, If the Paſſeover were to laſt for ever till Chriſts comming in the fleſh, then the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt laſt for ever till Chriſt come to judgement. Secondly, expound it <hi>for ever,</hi> that is, not in the ſigne, but in the ſubſtance; that is, in Chriſt, that is to ſay, for ever and ſo long as the world ſtandeth, and the fruit of it to all eternity, expound it ſo, for ſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16098:239"/>of the former Teſtament they doe ſtand good, and are good for ever in Chriſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them; take it in this ſenſe yet the reaſon holds well; for if ſo be that the Paſſeover ſhould laſt till the end of the world in Chriſt who is the ſubſtance of it, why then the Sacrament of the Lords Supper which is ordained of our Saviour to be a more lively reſemblance of his death than the firſt was, that muſt continue for ever alſo.</p>

It is partly the Apoſtles reaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10. in generall: <hi>We know but in part, we propheſie but in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then ſhall that which is imperfect be done away:</hi> our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge now is imperfect, all our graces are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; indeed if we could attaine to any perfection in this life, then happely this ſacrament might be taken from us, but there is no perfection to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto, but ſo long as here wee live ſo long we ſhall continue in need of this helpe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this helpe muſt be continued unto us ſo long as we live here.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16098:241"/>none can eſtabliſh a better Sacrament then this is, nay none can eſtabliſh the like, but Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, that which Chriſt will do in this caſe, he hath done already, and he is unchangeable, he will not take away this and ordaine another; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Sacrament is a perpetuall Sacrament of Chriſt to be obſerved by all the faithfull to the end of the world; The uſes of the doctrine are theſe:</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> The firſt uſe of this doctrine is this, this ſerves for matter of reproofe, firſt, for thoſe that doe neglect the uſe and the conſcionable obſervation of this holy Sacrament, a grievous fault among us, either we come not at all, or wee come very ſeldome, or at leaſt, we doe net come with that care and that conſcience to obſerve this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement without ſpot and unrebukable, to obſerve this holy ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, with that zeale &amp; that devotion that God hath required at our hands. Great is the negligence of many Miniſters, and many people in this caſe, but neither of them ſhall be excuſed but if the blinde lead the blinde, both ſhall fall into the ditch; if the Miniſter beare with the negligence of the people, if the people will beare with the negligence of the Miniſter, and ſo this ſaving ordinance of Chriſt be not put in practice as it ought, ſurely both ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the horrible indignation of the Lord: what a horrible indignity is this to God, that hee ſhall be preparing his Table, and calling us to this Table, and providing a great many ſweet dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for us, a matter that concernes us as much as
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16098:241"/>our ſoules are worth, and yet wee to turne our backes upon this Table, as who ſhould ſay we will have none of this; how can the Lord take this at our hands? In <hi>Luke</hi> 14.24. the King made a feaſt and ſent forth his ſervants to call thoſe that were bidden, and they began to make excuſes, one ſaid I have bought a farme, and he muſt goe and ſee it; another had bought five yoake of oxen, and hee muſt goe proove them, and another made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe that he had maried a wife, and therefore he could not come; what ſaith the great King in this caſe? Well goe forth, call in the poore, thoſe that lye under the hedges: for I tell you that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one of thoſe that were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper: Is it ſo? have I ſo graciouſly provided for them, and invited them, and are they ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in comming? Well, I will be eaven with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I tell you that never a one of theſe ſhall hereafter taſte of this Supper. It would be as fearful a found as ever ſounded in our eares, if God ſhould tell us by a voyce from heaven, Well, ſeeing you have neglected this ſaving ordinance of mine, ſeeing ye have refuſed to come to this Supper of mine, ye ſhall never be partakers of it in time to come; and therefore take heed of this, and let every one labour to reforme one, and amend this negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and let us hereafter come with zeale and true devotion, come with godly deſires and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, truly indeavouring to honour God in the uſe of his owne ſaving ordinance in that kinde as he hath inſtitute it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is matter of reproofe for thoſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16098:242"/>that doe any manner of way alter any thing in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; for ſeeing that it is thus ſet upright by Ieſus Chriſt, ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ordinance of God, wanting nothing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a grievous ſinne for any that ſhall lay hands upon it to alter it or to adde any thing to it. The Popiſh Church is guiltie highly of this ſinne, and of the wrath of God for it; how many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies have they defiled it withal, as by the croſſe namely, which as it is in uſe in the popiſh Church, is as abominable an Idoll as ever was erected amongſt them: It is in ſome uſe amongſt us after the Sacrament of Baptiſme, but to us, there is no Idolatry in it at all: and howſoever it be free, and farre from all Idolatry amongſt us, yet ſurely if it had crept within the Sacrament of Baptiſme; as it did creepe within the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, I make no queſtion, but our State being religious and wiſe, would have utterly caſt it out from the one Sacrament aſwell as from the other. But I ſay they ſtaine this Sacrament by admitting of the Croſſe into the Lords Supper: but that is not the worſt, they goe further, they maime this bleſſed Sacrament, they make this Communion but halfe a Communion, they deprive the people of the cup, let them have the bread, and much good may it doe them, but they ſhall have no wine; but our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Eate this bread and drinke this cup,</hi> he gave them bread and wine to eate and to drinke, and thus did he leave this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to be obſerved by them: now if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſhall come and deprive the people of one
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16098:242"/>halfe of this Communion, the ſervant ſheweth himſelfe to bee envious, where the Lord hath ſhewed himſelfe bountifull; the Lord hath given them both kinds, and the Papiſts give them but one: Nay what will you ſay if they overthrow this Sacrament utterly? ſurely they doe; for they turne the nature of the Sacrament into the nature of a ſacrifice, for with them this ſacrament is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: it is a Sacrament in the inſtitution of our Saviour Chriſt; but they will have it a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice for quicke and dead; this is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the nature of the Sacrament: they ſpoile it alſo with horrible Idolatry another way, in that they keep it but in one kind, that is, in the bread; and that very element of bread that Chriſt hath ſeparated to holy uſe, they have turned into a prophane and groſſe Idoll, they hold it verily to be a God; and if this be not to overthrow the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament, I know not what is.</p>

The Papiſts doe us wrong, when they charge us that we hold the Church is inviſible, or that at ſome time it is not viſible at all; true, in ſome ſenſe it is ſo; and the Scripture ſpeakes ſo, and ſome of the Papiſts themſelves doe ſpeake as much, but yet
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16098:243"/>not in that ſenſe as they charge us withall: the Church is ſometime ſo obſcured and eclipſed, that it is inviſible, that is to ſay, that the world cannot ſee it and take publike notice of it, but yet is it never ſo darkned, but that one profeſſor knowes another, and they doe meet together, though ſometimes happely but two or three, or a few, in the uſe of Gods ſaving ordinances; God never wants his Church in one place or another; the gates of hell ſhall never prevaile againſt it.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16098:243"/>the Church is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and Chriſt is her loving husband, loving it moſt dearly, moſt tenderly, and moſt affectionately; and therefore hee hath not onely provided meanes of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the time hee lives here upon earth, but now alſo that hee is abſent, that he is dead, and gone from them, ſtill their maintenance that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.

Chriſt would have us take notice of this his great care and love towards us. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.13. <hi>The Sonne of man is like unto a man going into a ſtrange Countrey, leaveth his houſe, &amp;c.</hi> So Chriſt left his houſe, that is, his Church for a time, that is, in regard of his bodily preſence; but he never left it in regard of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious providence: but hee gives authority to his ſervants, and leaves to every man his worke, and commands the porter to watch: ſee here how the Lord before he departed tooke order for the welfare of his Church and people, that it might be as well with them after he was gone, as it was before. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 16, 17, 18, <hi>verſ. I will pray the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16098:244"/>Father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and he ſhall give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter, that hee may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth whom the world hath not knowne:</hi> and ſo he proceedeth and ſaith, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe.</hi> The Apoſtles they were much daunted and diſmayed in themſelves when they heard that our Saviour would goe from them; alas what ſhall become of us, when the ſhepheard is ſmitten, the ſheepe will ſoone bee ſcattered: our Saviour would not have them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Well, bee of good comfort, when I am gone, I will pray to the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, and bee ſhall dwell with you for ever, though I be gone from you, yet he ſhall not.</hi> What Comforter is that? why, the Spirit of Truth that is in you, and dwells in you, and is among you: and ſo hee proceedeth and ſaith, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe,</hi> that is, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans or fatherleſſe children, though you poore ſoules thinke when I am gone, you ſhall bee like childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without a father, yet be of good comfort, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe,</hi> I will provide you as good a father as my ſelfe, I will ſend you the Spirit of truth to comfort you, and hee ſhall doe you as much good, as if I were preſent with you. The Apoſtles and the Diſciples of Chriſt, when Chriſt was preſent here, they had the Word and Sacraments, and Chriſt his bodily preſence with them; the Churches after our Saviours time they had the ſame Word and Sacraments; and though they had not his bodily preſence, yet they had the Spirit of Chriſt, who was as willing and ready
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16098:244"/>and as able to do as much for them as ever Chriſt did: and therefore is not the eſtate of the Church as good now in every reſpect as before it was? ſo it was then, ſo it is now, and ſo it ſhall continue to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>Another duty that here we are inſtructed in is this, it ſhould ſtirre us up the more to thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that we ſhould give thanks to God that hee hath ordained this comfortable meanes of our ſalvation, ſtil to continue to the end of the world. More generally it teacheth us, that we ſhould be thankfull to God for the whole Church living upon the face of the earth, that they and we being reſpited to live in theſe laſt daies, <hi>theſe perillous times,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. <hi>verſ.</hi> and theſe ſinfull dayes, as our Saviour foretold, <hi>when iniquitie ſhall abound, and the love of many ſhall waxe cold:</hi> yet the Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath beene pleaſed to afford us his owne ſaving ordinances, the ſame helps and means to keepe us in the right way, and to build us up to the Kingdome of God; to us I ſay, that live in this Iron age of the world, that the Apoſtles had and did enjoy in the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den age of Chriſt himſelfe. It is not the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Sacrament by our forefathers, nor the abuſe of it by our ſelves: It is not the cry of the ſinnes of the world for this ſixteene hundred yeares; it is not any one of theſe, nor all theſe that have or ever ſhall or can deprive the Church of God of this grace and mercy, ſurely if it could, long ere now bad this gracious light beene extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and taken from us, but bleſſed be God,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16098:245"/>that hath, and daily doth ſtop his eares againſt the cryes of our ſinnes; and ſtill though our ſinnes cry for vengeance, yet the Lord is pleaſed to continue theſe comfortable and ſaving ordinances unto us, theſe heavenly helps of our ſalvation, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Iacob, Iacob have I bleſſed, and he ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> Such is Chriſt his reſolution touching his Church, the Church hath beene bleſſed, and ſhe ſhall be bleſſed; it hath my Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhall have my Word and Sacraments continued to them to the end of the world: no prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhall ever get it from them.</p>
            <p>Secondly and more particularly, it ſhould ſtir us up that live here in this Land, in this City, and in this congregation, to more thankfulneſſe, that it hath pleaſed the Lord to admit us to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Church, and ſo to admit us to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate in this Sacrament; we have it, and we have free acceſſe unto it through Gods mercy, and we have it duely obſerved among us, and rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto us without any groſſe corruption, or any materiall change from our Saviours owne originall inſtitution, a bleſſing and a mercy that many of Gods people in many places of the world would purchaſe with the loſſe of all their goods, and the hazard of their lives too, if ſo they might procure it; but bleſſed be God, we have it, and doe injoy it with much peace, and with a full hand; let us take notice of this great mercy of God to us, and let us acknowledge this mercy of God, and eſteeme of it and that highly, and let us give unto GOD the due honour and praiſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16098:245"/>that belongs to him for the ſame.</p>
            <p>The laſt duty that here we are inſtructed unto is this, Is it ſo that God hath appointed this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to continue to the end of the world? why then every one of us ſhould labour, and doe the beſt we can to the uttermoſt of our power for the continuance of it, and for the continuance of the reſt of Gods ſaving ordinances to the worlds end; and not to ſay onely, Let there bee peace in our dayes, and let the Goſpell flouriſh in our daies, let us have acceſſe to the ſacrament while we live; but to labour that the people of God that ſhall live in time to come to the end of the world, may have them and injoy them as well as we. But you will ſay, we can but looke to it for our time, how can wee doe it for the time to come? I anſwer, whileſt we live here, and while wee have theſe things, let us highly eſteeme of them, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently embrace them, and make a conſcionable uſe of them. This is one meanes whereby we ſhall procure men to love them, and may procure from the Lord the continuance of theſe his ordinances to our poſterity. Secondly, let us not onely ſo doe, but labour to countenance theſe things, to plead for them, to fight for them, and to ſtrive for them, to the utmoſt of our power. Thirdly, and not onely ſo, but let us call upon others that live among us to come to the houſe of God, and to make uſe of his ſaving ordinances: Let us not be ſuch graceleſs wretches as to ſuffer others to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſuch a gracious ſalvation as the Lord tenders unto them, let us charge them, that they charge
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16098:246"/>their poſterity to doe the like. Fourthly, we muſt yet goe further, and walke worthy of them, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of thoſe ſaving ordinances of God: if we have the light, let us walke as children of the light; if we have the Goſpell, let us walke worthy of the Goſpell; if we have the Word and Sacraments, let us ſhew forth the fruit and power of them. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Repent and doe thy firſt workes, or elſe I will come againſt thee, and remove thy candleſticke:</hi> I, it is juſt with God to remove the candleſticke from a place, if the people there doe not labour to walke worthy of their light, and ſhew forth the power of it in their lives and converſations: yet further, we muſt not onely doe this, but alſo as much as in us lyeth doe what we can while we live to further Gods ordinances to thoſe that ſhall live after us; leave ſome good monument behinde us to that effect. If God have given us riches, let us give ſomething to maintaine Gods ordinances to the end of the world. It is an excellent thing when God hath given any man abundance of wealth, and hath given him withall a heart to part with ſome of it for the maintenance of Gods ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the worlds end; yea if occaſion ſo require, let us ſeale Gods truth with our blood, this is the beſt monument of all. Laſtly, and ſo I end; all mans power being nothing of himſelfe, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in all: wee muſt therefore pray to God while we live here, not onely that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Word and Sacraments to us, but pray that he would continue the ſame to our poſterity after us, to many generations, yea even to the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16098:246"/>end of the world, if it bee his bleſſed will. In 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. <hi>Salomon</hi> when he built the Temple, hee did not onely pray for that time, but for the time to come: <hi>Then whenſoever hereafter thy people ſhall be oppreſſed with the ſword or famine, or ſuch like, and ſhall pray to thee in this Temple, heare thou in heaven, and be mercifull unto them.</hi> So we muſt labour not onely to pray to God to fence his Church, and plant his Vineyard, and nouriſh thoſe plants that are in it already, but that he would ſtill continue to make a ſupply of ſuch plants, ſo long as the Sun and Moone ſhall endure: and this would teſtifie a true zeale that wee beare to the glory of God. We know (beloved) in regard of our owne buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, if we purchaſe lands for our ſelves, or our children, we deſire that it may continue for ever to our childrens children: What, ſhall we not be as zealous for Gods glory, as wee are carefull for our owne children? yes, wee ought much more, and therefore we ſhould bee ſtirred up ſtill to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as much as in us lyeth, by prayer and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good meanes, for the continuance of the Word and Sacraments, and all the ſaving ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, not onely unto us, but to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, to our childrens children, to the Church of God even to the end of the world.</p>

            <head>The One AND TWENTIETH LECTVRE VPON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORDS SVPPER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 11. verſe 26. the laſt part of the verſe, <hi>till he come: For as often as yee ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how wee divided this Scripture into two parts: we ſhewed that in the former part of the verſe there is an action per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; in the latter part of the verſe there is a caution that it is to be performed withall: in the former part of the verſe is the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper: The caution that it is to be performed withall, in the latter part of the verſe, is the ſhewing forth of the Lords death till he come. Not to trouble you with repeating
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16098:248"/>of many things: In this latter part of the verſe we obſerved unto you, firſt the Caution it ſelfe, the ſhewing forth of the Lords death: ſecondly, the frequenting of the Caution, that it muſt bee often done; for howſoever this word <hi>often</hi> is not uſed in the latter part of the verſe, yet in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſtruction and underſtanding, it is to bee ſupplyed out of the former part of the verſe, <hi>As often as ye ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ſo often ſhall ye ſhew forth the Lords death:</hi> and laſtly, I came to ſpeake of the continuance of this whole duty, the whole that is here ſpoken of, how long muſt this continue; till Chriſt come, that is to ſay, as long as the world ſtands, till Ieſus Chriſt ſhall come to Iudgement. Wee are entred upon this clauſe already: I ſhewed you that this clauſe doth offer unto us two things for our conſideration; the firſt is the continuance it ſelfe of this duty, how long it ſhall be, to the end of the world; that the obſervation of the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the remembring or the ſhewing forth of the death of Chriſt muſt continue among the faithfull, and be duly obſerved by them, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of the world; that is directly affirmed here as you ſee. I ſhewed you that there is another thing that is here covertly implyed, and yet plaine enough, if wee conſider and weigh the words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, namely, the end or the reach which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of this duty ayme at, or which wee muſt ayme at in the performance of this duty, namely, to fit us and prepare us to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt unto Iudgement. Wee have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16098:248"/>ſpoken of the former part already; now as GOD ſhal inable us we are to proceed to the latter part, and ſo to finiſh up this Scripture at this time. Therefore here ſecondly, wee muſt conſider that which is covertly implyed, namely, the end or the reach that theſe actions or theſe duties aime at, or that we muſt aime at in the performance of theſe duties, to fit us and prepare us to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt unto judgement: that the doctrine that hence we are to raiſe may appeare to be built upon a firme and a ſure ground, wee muſt ſhew theſe two things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that this particle that here is uſed, <hi>till,</hi> hath the ſame uſe in the ſame ſenſe elſewhere in the Scripture, not onely to ſignifie the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an action till that time, but withall to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that that continuance is ſuch a preparation. to ſuch an action.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt ſhew that it is ſo to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here; for it is not alwaies in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo meant, therfore there muſt be ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inducement alleaged why it muſt bee ſo taken here.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, that this particle is uſed in the ſame ſenſe, elſewhere, I gave you one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the opening of the Text, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. where it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt ſhould raigne till he had put all his enemies under his feet.</hi> For there is the ſame particle that is uſed here, and it ſignifies not onely that Chriſt ſhould raigne till his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould be deſtroyed, but by his raigning, his enemies ſhould be deſtroyed. Take another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16098:249"/>or two for better confirmation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My little children,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>of whom I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in birth till Chriſt bee formed in you:</hi> there is the very ſame particle alſo: In thoſe words, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle as you may ſee compares himſelfe to a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mother, he is alwaies in paine and in travell in the ſpirit, and in the worke of the miniſtery, till ſuch time as Chriſt ſhould be formed and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the hearts of theſe <hi>Galathians, till that time,</hi> there that ſame word <hi>(till)</hi> intends theſe two things; Firſt, that the paines and the travell of <hi>Paul</hi> in this ſpirituall child-birth did indure with in him till ſuch time as Chriſt was formed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned in the hearts of the <hi>Galathians:</hi> and moreover that thoſe very paines and trauel of the Apoſtle in that very ſpirituall child-birth, were a meanes wherby Chriſt was ſo formed and framed in them, for ſo the compariſon doth neceſſarily inforce from a naturall mother, we know a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mother hath continuall paines and throes ever and anon till the child bee ripe to the birth, and brought forth into the world, it continues with her all that time. I, and beſides, thoſe paines and thoſe throes of hers are a meanes whereby the childe is ſo made ripe to the birth &amp; brought forth into the world, and ſo it was with <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſpirituall child-birth, the paines that hee did beare in this his child-birth, it is to be underſtood that they did continue with him till that worke was effected; and moreover, that they were a meanes whereby it was effected; Another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>I am confident that the Lord that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16098:249"/>hath begun this good worke will performe it till the day of the Lord:</hi> there is the ſame particle in the very ſame ſenſe; the Apoſtles meaning is this, that he is perſwaded, that as God had given them the light of his Goſpel, and wrought faith in them, ſo he would give them the light of his Goſpell, hee would ſtill teach them and keepe them in the faith, till the day of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And moreover, that by this teaching and keeping of them in the faith, hee would make them fit and ready for the day of the Lord; ſo much for the firſt point, namely, that this particle which here is ſpoken of, <hi>till,</hi> is ſo uſed in this ſame ſenſe, that we doe now ſpeake of it, elſewhere in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are to ſhew what inducement is there to proue that it is ſo uſed here; why the circumſtance of the text affords it clearly, theſe words that I have here, you fee they are added as a reaſon of the words that went before, for ſo the inference is, <hi>for as often as ye ſhall eate this bread and drinke this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> The words that went immediately before are the words of our Saviour, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me:</hi> the Apoſtle gives the expoſition of theſe words, by way of a reaſon, for <hi>as often as ye ſhal eate this bread and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death til he come;</hi> and ſo the expoſition of the Apoſtle makes our Saviours words, and our Saviours meaning to bee cleare, as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me till I come,</hi> or againſt I come, as who ſhould ſay, ſee that yee doe duely obſerve this ſame Sacrament of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16098:250"/>Lords Supper till I come; ſee that yee doe duely and affectionatly meditate upon my death till I come, that when I doe come then ye may bee fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ready for my comming; ye may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by theſe meanes to give me the better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and I ſeeing your faithfulneſſe and your conſtancy, and readineſſe in obſerving my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and my directions ſo duely, I may then when I doe come, give you a comfortable porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me, till I come,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt I come, that ſo you may bee fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for my comming. This is the very ſtraine and reach or the Text; we are to underſtand one thing further, and that is this, that howſoever this is here intended particularly of theſe two duties of the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lord, and of the meditation of Chriſts death, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by way of proportion, and by way of conſequence, the ſame is alſo to bee affirmed concerning all duties in religion whatſoever, all other outward meanes; yea all other meanes of grace, whether outward or inward: for they all muſt joyne together in one and the ſame finall end: This being the finall end of theſe two du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to prepare us to the day of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, except wee will make a diſproportion in religious duties; as if ſome of them ſhould tend to one end, and ſome to another; we muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently underſtand that all the duties of religion they tend to this end, to fit us and prepare us to the comming of Ieſus Chriſt unto judgement. The grounds being thus laid, the doctrine ariſeth
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16098:250"/>plaine, <hi>Doe this till I come,</hi> the Sacrament of the Lords Supper duely obſerved, and the effectuall meditation of Chriſts death, and conſequently all other duties and exerciſes of religion, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes of grace both inward and outward, they are ſo many ſerviceable meanes and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and helps unto the faithfull, whereby they are fitted and prepared for the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt unto judgement.</p>
            <p>Where I named the receiving of the Lords Supper and the effectuall meditation of Chriſts death, that is cleare in this text, concerning all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties, other Scriptures doe ſerve to make that cleare, and give plentifull witneſſe of it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. from the firſt to the thirteenth, there is the parable of the ten Virgins, five were wiſe, and five were fooliſh; they went all out to meet their Bridegroome, five had oile, and five had none; the Bridegroome comes, they were all awake, as they were aſleepe before: the wiſe they had their oile, they went in with the Bridegroome; the fooliſh they had none, and they were kept out: in a word, the meaning of the parable is this; Thoſe Virgins are the viſible Church here upon earth, the wiſe Virgins they are true beleevers, the fooliſh Virgins they are hypocrites: their Lamps that they have all of them, is the outward profeſſion that they make of religion in the uſe of the outward meanes, the Word and Sacraments, theſe bee the Lamps, theſe bee common both to the fooliſh and to the wiſe; the oyle they have in their Lamps is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16098:251"/>graces of Gods Spirit in their hearts, faith and repentance, and ſuch like; and theſe onely the wiſe Virgins had, the fooliſh have none at all: all theſe Virgins they goe forth to meet the Bridegroome, as in the firſt verſe: the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome is the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the comming of the Bridegroome, is his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to judgment, and ſo their meeting of the Bridegroome, it is their fitting, and their preparing of themſelves for the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt unto judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: well then you ſee all theſe Virgins, the whole viſible Church, the fooliſh as well as the wiſe, the wiſe onely in truth, the fooliſh in ſhew, they as well as the other make uſe of their lamps; of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in the Word &amp; the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: to what end? to fit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Chriſt his comming, for that is their pretence; the wiſe they make uſe not onely of their lamps, but alſo of their oyle too, that is, of their inward graces: to what end, to fit them to meet the Lord Ieſus, that when the Bridegroome doth come they may bee ready to enter in with him; the caſe you ſee is very cleare, all the duties of religion that wee doe performe either outward duties, or inward graces, they bee as ſo many ſerviceable helps unto us, whereby wee are fitted and prepared for the day of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: our Saviour in the 13. verſe of that Chapter by occaſion of the excluding and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the fooliſh Virgins, becauſe they had no oyle in their lamps, no grace in their hearts, he therefore gives us an exhortation, <hi>Wath therefore,</hi> why watch? <hi>becauſe yee know not when the Sonne of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16098:251"/>man ſhall come.</hi> As if our Saviour ſhould ſay; Certainly the Sonne of man ſhall come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if he doe come and finde you unready, you ſhall bee in a moſt wofull and miſerable caſe: watch therefore, ſee that yee have your lamps ready in your hands, eſpecially ſee that you have oyle burning in your lamps, that ſo when the Sonne of man ſhall come, yee may bee ready to give him gracious entertainment; and ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour confirmes it by that exhortation that hee gives them, <hi>watch, &amp;c.</hi> that all theſe meanes and exerciſes of Religion, what are they? why they be ſerviceable helps to fit us to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt unto judgment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35, 36. <hi>Let your loynes be girt about you, and your lights bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and ye as men that doe wait for the comming of their Maſter, that when he commeth, and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</hi> In the girding of our loynes, in the burning of our lights, in our watching, in all the duties of religion both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward, that we performe, we muſt cary our ſelves as men that wait the comming of our Maſter from the wedding, as men that expect the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to judgement; that whenſoever he doth come and knocke, when our Lord and Maſter ſhall come and knocke, what may we doe? we may open to him, that is, we may be ready to give him gracious entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that immediatly, without any lett or hinderance, without any delay, as being fitted and prepared thereunto by theſe duties and exerciſes before hand. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36. <hi>Watch therefore and

Titus</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, <hi>verſes, The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men hath appeared, teaching us that we ſhould deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and that we ſhould live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent evill world, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the bleſſed hope and appearing of the glory of the mighty God, and of our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſaving grace of God that there the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, teacheth us two things, as the Apoſtle ſhewes.

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> he goeth one ſtep further, for whereas
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16098:252"/>the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> he had ſaid there, looking for the bleſſed hope, ſo manage all your buſineſſes that ye may have a gracious eye to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hee goeth one ſtep further, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Seeing that all theſe things muſt bee, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holineſs &amp; godly converſation, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for and haſtning unto the comming of the day of the Lord in the performance of the duties of holines &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes:</hi> we muſt not only have our eyes fixed upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the comming of the day of the Lord, but haſten to it, that is to ſay, we muſt ſo cary our ſelves in the managing of theſe duties, that in every good duty that we doe, ſtill we may bee fitted and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared for the comming of the day of God, and nearer to it than we were before, looking for, and haſtning unto the comming of the day of God. You ſee theſe places prove the doctrine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, for all religious duties: now for theſe two in particular, I will give you a proofe for each, and ſo come to the Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the performance of the dutie of receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that is a ſerviceable meanes, and a good duty to fit us to the day of Ieſus Chriſt; our Saviour would give us to underſtand ſo much in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. <hi>Henceforth I will drinke no more of this Vine, till I drinke it new with you in my Fathers kingdome:</hi> our Saviour uſed that ſpeech immediately after the Paſſeover; and after that hee had inſtituted the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he makes a kinde of a ſweet alluſion betweene
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16098:253"/>the drinking of the wine in the Sacrament, and the drinking of wine in the kingdome of heaven. Now you muſt conſider, that by drinking of the wine in the Kingdome of heaven, wee are not to underſtand that we ſhall drinke wine there, but that there we ſhall have a Communion with Chriſt in his heavenly kingdome, which hee by way of alluſion calleth the drinking of the wine new in his heavenly kingdome: thereby our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour giveth us to underſtand that the conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and the religious receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, the conſcionable, and religious, and ſpirituall drinking of the wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is a ſpeciall meanes whereby we are furthered, and fitted, and prepared to drinke new wine with Chriſt in the kingdome of heaven, that is to ſay, to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of that glory that Chriſt ſhall make us partakers of in heaven: for the other, that the death of Chriſt effectually remembred doth ſo too: looke <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>So Chriſt was once offered to take away the ſinnes of many, and the ſecond time hee ſhall appeare without ſinne to ſalvation:</hi> The Apoſtle there makes a kinde of compariſon betweene Chriſt and us in two things, his death is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ours, and likewiſe his judgement to ours; we dye, and we come to judgement; Chriſt Ieſus he dyeth, and he ſhall come to judgement too; he to judge, we to be judged; and we muſt make uſe of our death for our judgement, and we muſt make uſe of the death of Chriſt with reference to his judgement: not to meditate upon it as once
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16098:253"/>ſuffered for us all, as who ſhould ſay there to ſtay, but ſo to meditate upon it, as that we ſhould have a piercing eye to looke upon him for his ſecond comming, wherein he ſhall appeare to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of the doctrine are theſe: marke the doctrine: the receiving of the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, the effectuall meditating of Chriſts death, and conſequently all other exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Religion, all other meanes of grace, both inward and outward, they are ſerviceable helps and meanes whereby the faithfull are fitted and prepared to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to judgement.</p>

            <p>The uſes of the doctrine are theſe: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> the firſt uſe is this, this commends unto us in the firſt place, the infinite goodneſſe, and the infinite wiſedome of God toward his children, that hee doth traine us up as it were by little and little, by certaine ſteps, and by certaine degrees to the full poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that heavenly Kingdome, which ſhall bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us at Chriſts ſecond comming. This is the wonderfull wiſedome and the infinite goodneſſe of God: wee know that the ſecond comming of Chriſt it is a wonderful and glorious thing; we know that the knowledge, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and joy, and happineſſe, and fruition of God, that when we ſhall bee made partakers of in that happy eſtate, they are high points, matters of a very high ſtraine, infinitely beyond the reach of a mortall man in this ſtate of corruption; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is the infinite goodneſſe of God, that hee will have us to be made partakers of theſe things; and it is the infinite wiſedome of God to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to our capacitie, to our dull and ſhallow underſtanding; that whereas we could not receive all theſe things as they are in themſelves all at once, he guides us, and leades us as it were by the hand by a little and a little, here a line, and there a line, here a little and there a little; here a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and there a precept, carying us by certaine degrees from lower things to higher things, from ſmaller things to greater; from things more knowne, to things more unknowne, from nothing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16098:257"/>to a little, from a little to much, and from much in the end to perfection; this is the great and the wonderfull wiſedome of God towards us; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand there be three ſpeciall aſcents as a man would ſay, or three ſpeciall degrees in the ſtate of religion, whereby wee doe aſpire to our perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Religion; the firſt aſcent, or the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is the outward meanes of grace, the Word and the Sacraments. The ſecond aſcent or degree is the life of grace wrought in our hearts by this meanes. The third and the laſt aſcent and degree is the perfection of glory that wee attaine unto at Chriſts comming; theſe bee the three aſcents whereby we attaine perfection in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtep and aſcent is this, the outward meanes of grace, wee have the Word and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, wee receive the Word and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wee conforme our ſelves to theſe outward duties: theſe be ſome degrees of perfection; yet they be but a very low degree, ſo low that many come to this degree, and yet never come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet they are very materiall, and ſo mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, as that none ordinarily can come to heaven without theſe, this is the beginning of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, this is as it were our A. B. C. as a man would ſay, and when we come to know theſe, we come to know a little, and to ſmatter a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter of our perfection: theſe bee the firſt degree.</p>
            <p>The ſecond aſcent is the life of grace which is wrought in the hearts of Gods children by theſe outward meanes effectuated, and ſeconded by
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16098:257"/>the Spirit of God within us; our new birth, faith, repentance, new obedience and humiliation, and ſuch like; this is the life of grace wrought within us, theſe now bee ſomewhat a neerer degree to perfection, theſe be the next ſteps to it, now wee begin to ſeize upon Chriſt, to ſeize upon heaven, and to ſeize upon perfection: when wee have theſe graces, then we begin to have a feeling of Ieſus Chriſt in our ſoules, this is as it were to ſpell perfection, and to ſpell Chriſt, and to ſpell hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for now wee doe not onely know the letters as we did in our A. B. C. but now we know how to put the letters and the ſyllables together, and how to make it up: in theſe very things, that wee doe beleeve here, that we hope here, that we love here, that we performe and obey God in here, in theſe very things we doe as it were ſpell Chriſt, and ſpell heaven, and ſpell perfection; yet we are not come to the reading of them.</p>
            <p>There is a third aſcent or degree in religion, and that is the ſtate of perfection, when Ieſus Chriſt at his ſecond comming ſhall inveſt us, and put us into full poſſeſſion of all that ever hee hath purchaſed for us, a matter that we are uncapable of here in this world, therefore it is reſpited to be revealed at his ſecond comming; and when once we come to be made partakers of that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming, then we come to be ripe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſchollers, then we begin to throw away our bookes, to throw away the Word and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we have no further uſe of them, they ſhall then all ceaſe; now wee have our leſſon perfect,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16098:258"/>we can ſee Chriſt cleerly, we can read Chriſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, we can underſtand Chriſt fully, wee are ripe and perfect ſchollers; and that is the ſtate that we are advanced unto when Chriſt ſhall come to judgement. A reſemblance of this threefold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was given unto us in the very frame of the Tabernacle, in the 25, 26, and 27. chapters of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Tabernacle there were three diviſions or roomes; there was firſt the Court, then there was the holy, and then the holieſt of all, or the holy of holies: The Court that was for the people, as well as for the Prieſts; the holy, that was for the Prieſts onely to come to doe the ſervice of the Lord in it; and the holieſt of all, that was for the high Prieſt onely to come into, and that was but once a yeare; the firſt aſcent, the outward meanes, the Word and the Sacraments, they are as the Court of the Tabernacle of God, there come the Prieſts, and the people, there all communicate together, many wicked and many ungodly and prophane perſons, few in deed &amp; in truth, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſhew of religion; all that while we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the neerer to heaven; I, but when wee come to the ſecond diviſion, then we come to the holy; and that is when we are effectually called into the ſtate of grace: and in this ſtate it is, that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all Gods ſervice that hee requires; as the Prieſts did in the holy: Here we pray, here we offer up our ſelves and our ſoules and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and all our ſpirituall ſacrifices to God in Chriſt: here wee exerciſe the power and the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16098:258"/>life of grace that God indues us withall. There is yet a higher diviſion, that is the holieſt of all: and that is heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. there is our ſtate of perfection, if ſo be that we ſtay in the Court, wee are never the better for the Tabernacle: but if ſo be that we proceed to the ſecond diviſion to goe to the holy, then we have true intereſt in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; ſo if we ſtay at the Word and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, we are never the neerer to ſalvation. I, but if we have the life of grace in us, then we ſhall be ſure to be made partakers of the holieſt of all, the Kingdome of heaven. God might, if it had pleaſed him, beſtow this perfection upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch degrees, without any ſuch riſings or aſcents; but God deales with man according to the reach and capacity of man, he deales with his creatures, according to the capacity of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore it is the infinite wiſedome of God, that we being ſo unable and ſo uncapable of matters of heaven, that the Lord is pleaſed to raiſe us up by certaine degrees, till at laſt he hath brought us to be perfect men and women in Ieſus Chriſt: let us ſee and diſcerne the wiſedome of God in it, and let us admire it, and let us ſubmit our ſelves to it. Every man would deſire to come to the holieſt of all, and then they think all would be ſafe with them. Looke not to it without good cauſe, for before thou commeſt to the holieſt of all, thou muſt come to the holy; before thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to the holy, thou muſt come to the Porch; before thou commeſt to heaven thou muſt have the life of grace in thy heart, and before thou have
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:16098:259"/>the life of grace in thy heart, thou muſt make a conſcionable uſe of the Word and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and whoſoever thinkes to come to heaven without the conſcionable uſe of theſe, he doth not uſe the meanes to come thither: And therefore let us ſubmit our ſelves to the wiſedome of God in this caſe; and therefore let us try and examine our eſtate, how farre we have proceeded in this ſtate; and therefore let us examine our ſelves whether wee bee them onely that can know our letters, or ſpell, or reade.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> A ſecond uſe that we are to make of this point is this, this ſheweth us what we are to eſteeme of the Word and Sacraments, and indeed of the graces that we attaine unto in this life: why, we are to eſteeme of them as good, and as comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things, not as the matter and ſubſtance of our ſalvation, but as helps and meanes to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor faith, nor repentance, they are but onely meanes to helpe us to heaven; not the Word and the Sacraments, as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>He was not that light, but he was ſent to beare witneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> The Word and the Sacraments they are not the ſalvation that we looke to have, but they are tendered to us of God, to beare witneſſe of that perfection, to beare witneſſe of Chriſt, and to beare witneſſe of heaven: and therefore this ſhould ſerve to reprove thoſe that doe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly and vainly &amp; preſumptuouſly boaſt of their outward eſtate, becauſe they live in the viſible Church, as though they ſhould ſurely goe to heaven; many will conclude, if they can come

The Phariſee paid tithes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted twice a weeke, and yet a curſed firebrand of hell, and therefore let no man thinke the better of themſelves for this, without thou canſt come to ſee what benefit thou haſt made of thoſe, unleſſe thou canſt come to ſee that the life of grace is wrought in thy heart by theſe meanees: as for example, if ſo be that a man have clothes heated at the fire for him, if they be never ſo warme, and they put upon his body, yet it is not the warmneſſe of the clothes that he ſhall live by, but the warmneſſe of his body; ſo ought we having the Word and the Sacraments, and they being powerfull, yet they ſhall not profit us without we have grace in our hearts. It is not the Wine and the Sacraments that ſhall ſave us; it is not our clothes but our bodies that ſhall warme us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we have this grace we ſhall not be the neerer to life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhewed you that the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16098:260"/>they are not the ſubſtance of our ſalvation, not our faith, nor our repentance, but a meanes of our ſalvation. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. We know that we are the ſonnes of God, but we know not what we ſhall be; a ſtrange thing, we are here already the ſonnes of God, this we know, but we know not what wee ſhall be; as who ſhould ſay, that the ſtate of Gods children in heaven doth ſo farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the ſtate of grace here, though they know this, yet they doe not know that: therefore reſt not in thy faith as it is in it ſelfe, but reſt upon God, that promiſeth to juſtifie thee by faith; God ſet his love upon us, God adopted us, yet that is nothing. There is a ſweet proportion between the life of grace here, and the ſtate of glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and to ſay the truth they doe agree in this, the ſubſtance of the truth is one and the ſame, ſo farre forth as we are capable of them, here in this world; but yet in circumſtance they differ, but in ſubſtance they are the ſame: firſt, the perſons they are the ſame, they that are made partakers of the ſtate of grace here, ſhall be ſure to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſtate of glory hereafter; all that are partakers of heaven, ſhall be made partakers of grace here alſo, the objects, and things, the ſame God, the ſame Chriſt, the ſame bleſſed things that we doe enjoy.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the right is the ſame; all the right that we have to grace in this life, all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that wee ſhall have in the world to come, is through the mediation of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Chriſt Ieſus yeſterday and to day, and the ſame
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16098:260"/>for ever; Chriſt Ieſus in the ſtate of grace, and in the ſtate of glory; but yet there is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, they differ in circumſtance of grace; grace is managed here upon earth, and glory in heaven: againe, there is difference in the time, matters of grace they are managed onely for a time, for the preſent diſpenſation of this life; matters of glory they laſt for ever: againe, they differ in the manner, becauſe matters of glory are apprehended here by faith, and then they ſhall be apprehended by ſight and appearance; we beleeve now onely, we then ſhall ſee that which now we doe beleeve. Laſtly, there is difference in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in the degree; grace, I muſt needs ſay, it is ſome beginning of glory, but it comes farre ſhort of glory, it is nothing to glory; now wee are in part, then we ſhall be perfect; then we ſhall know as we are knowne; now we ſee but darkly, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. but then we ſhall ſee face to face: great difference in regard of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and meaſure, here wee have them onely in part, there we ſhall have them in full; here wee have them onely in a darke glaſſe, as a man would ſay, but there we ſhall have them in a cleare glaſs: That ſpeech there of the Queene of <hi>Sheba,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.7. may very fitly be compared to this: the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> had heard of the wiſedome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſhe made a journey, and came to ſee it, and when ſhe had ſeene it, ſhee gave this report, Well, I have heard a great report of thee, but I have not heard the halfe of that which now I ſee: there was a great deale more that ſhee beheld, or
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16098:261"/>that ſhe heard of: And ſo likewiſe may wee ſay concerning the ſtate of grace and the ſtate of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, We know a great many things that God hath treaſured up in heaven for thoſe that doe beleeve in him, as glory, happineſſe, and bleſſedneſſe: when we come there we ſhall utterly diſclaime all thoſe kindes of knowledge; I, wee ſhall behold a thouſand times more than ever we knew of theſe things before.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> The laſt Vſe: this ſerves for inſtruction: it ſhould ſtirre us up, that ſeeing it is ſo that theſe outward meanes of holineſſe, and inward graces, they be ſerviceable meanes of the fitting of us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of Chriſt, therefore every one of us ſhould labour to performe theſe duties, ſo as to make this our reach, making this our ayme, that wee may bee fitted to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and becauſe that the day of our death is partly a beginning of the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to us in particular, therefore let us labour ſtill ſo to pray, as that wee ſhould dye preſently, ſtill ſo to heare the Word and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as though thou ſhouldeſt dye preſently: when we come to heare the Word, do not think of the Word as it is the word of a mortall man, but as Chriſt ſaith, heare it as the word that ſhall judge thee at the laſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. and therefore heare it, and hearken unto it, and conſider of it reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently as thou oughteſt to doe, as thou ſhouldeſt be judged by it as the laſt day: and ſo likewiſe in the receiving of the ſacrament. Oh if we would conſider with our ſelves, when we come to lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our death-bed we ſhall have need of comfort, if we had never ſo much comfort and grace at the day of death, and at the day of judgement, wee ſhall have need of all; there is no comfort to bee
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16098:262"/>had but by our faith and repentance, and gracious courſes that we have walked in in the time of our life, and in the time of our death: therefore let us looke to theſe things, ſtill let us labour to perform them in our daily converſation, that ſo wee may be fitted for Chriſts particular comming to us, or elſe his generall comming to the whole world. You have heard of the fooliſh Virgins: get it in time, have it alwayes burning, and then we ſhall be ſure: ſpecially make uſe of the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: this ſhould teach us in the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; we ſhould ſo addreſſe our ſelves, and ſo cary our ſelves every way, and ſo goe away with ſuch hearts, and having ſuch meditations in them, as that we may be fitted every way for the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: Oh that our hearts were ſo fitted, oh how reverently would we cary our ſelves in the practice of it; with what conſcience would we performe it, to glorifie God, and to pleaſe God, with what ſingleneſſe of heart? We know that when Chriſt ſhall come to judgement there ſhall bee no hiding of any thing, out every thing ſhall bee naked before him, and there will bee no ſmoothering up of any thing. He that hath beſt profited by receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, whoſoever he bee that is thereby beſt fitted to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to judgment, he deſires it more earneſtly, waits for it more diligently, rejoyces in it more cheerfully, and haſtens to it more willingly and more comfortably. Oh when a man
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16098:262"/>hath beene at the Lords Table, and there hath found and felt the ſweet communion of Gods bleſſed Spirit in his hart, aſſuring him by his ſpirit within him, aſſuring him that his ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, aſſuring him that now he is fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconciled to God: when he can enjoy this communion with Ieſus Chriſt, then he may goe home to his cloſet and ſay, Oh now Lord Ieſus come quickly, now thy ſervant is in ſome poore meaſure ready and fitted. Oh there is a worthy, and a profitable, and a ready Communicant. This profit is to be found in this ſacrament by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable uſing of it; here God tenders it, and it is to be found of us, and therefore let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our ſelves of ſuch a gracious and precious bleſſing that here is: if we will ſubmit our ſelves to the gracious ordinance of God, wee may bee made partakers of it: the time will come that thou whoſoever thou art that art negligent in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to it, or unprofitable in the participation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the time will come when thou commeſt to lye upon thy death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, eſpecially when thou commeſt to judgment, then thou wilt rue this folly of thine with unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable woe and miſery: I, then you ſhall cry out, and ſhame your owne ſoules and your owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe you have not beene profitable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipators in this Sacrament, and profitably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, to the comfort of your owne ſoules.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are ſtill to continue in the Argument of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for our preparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next Sabbath day, when we purpoſe, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to be made partakers of this Sacrament. Wee have gone over many names and titles that are given to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which very fitly and lively expreſſe the nature of it: ſome of which names common to the whole action, ſome to the ſeverall parts of it; we have already recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up five names or titles that are all common to the whole action; as namely, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Table of the Lord, the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt, the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his blood, and the memoriall of Chriſts
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16098:264"/>death: I might adde to theſe ſome other names, that are common alſo to the whole action, as namely, the Euchariſt, the Chriſtian Paſſeover, a Love-feaſt, and ſuch like; for ſuch names and titles are applyed to this Sacrament by many of the Ancients, and approved by ſome later Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; and that not unaptly, nor without ſome probable warrant out of Gods word: But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I doe not finde in the Scripture that any of theſe names or titles are expreſly and directly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of this Sacrament, I will paſſe them by; and now proceed to the ſecond ſort of names, that are more proper to the ſeverall parts of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: For whereas the Sacrament of the Lords Supper conſiſts of two parts, the bread and the cup; the Scripture by the Figure Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, putting a part for the whole, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this whole Sacrament under the name of bread, and ſometime under the name of the cup: I will give you an inſtance in both: And firſt to begin with the bread; looke into <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. and there you ſhall finde this Sacrament cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the breaking of bread; and that is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that God willing we will treat upon for this argument. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>And they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi> All the contents of this verſe doe in ſome ſort concerne the matter of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for not onely the breaking of bread, but the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and prayers, are matters of neceſſary uſe, in and for the right receiving of this Sacrament; and therefore let us
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16098:264"/>take this verſe wholly as it lyes before us. This verſe and the next immediately going before, ſet forth the gracious and happy ſucceſſe of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sermon that <hi>Peter</hi> made, after the ſending downe of the viſible gifts of the Holy Ghoſt on him and the reſt of the Apoſtles: The ſending downe of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt is ſhewed in the 1.2. and 3. verſes: the power and effect of them is ſhewed partly in all the Apoſtles, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the Holy Ghoſt, verſe 4. to 13. ſpecially in <hi>Peter,</hi> who made a pithy, piercing, and powerfull Sermon on that occaſion, verſe 14. to 40. The ſucceſſe of which Sermon is partly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched verſe 37. where it is ſaid, that they that heard it <hi>were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid unto Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> and it is more enlarged in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars from the 43. verſe to the end of the Chapter. But the ſumme of all is briefly compriſed in this verſe and the next going before: in the verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſhewed how the Church was thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: in this verſe it is ſhewed how that they being encreaſed were afterward employed: their encreaſe is there called their <hi>adding to the Church:</hi> for though <hi>Church</hi> be not expreſt in the originall, yet it is to be underſtood; as in the 47. verſe, <hi>and the Lord added to the Church, &amp;c.</hi> their encreaſe is their adding to the Church: here is their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; And this is ſet forth partly by their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; partly by the meanes of their adding. Their number, three thouſand ſoules; a plentifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of ſo little ſeed; three thouſand ſoules at one
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16098:265"/>Sermon! The barrenneſſe of our times is ſuch as we may make three thouſand Sermons, and haply not winne three ſoules; but the fruitfulneſſe of thoſe times were ſuch, that <hi>Peter</hi> at one Sermon did winne three thouſand ſoules: this was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and prime and firſt fruits of the viſible gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. The meanes whereby they were gathered to the Church, and admitted to bee of the Church, are ſet downe in theſe words, <hi>and they that gladly received his word;</hi> there is the means of their gathering: <hi>and were baptized;</hi> there is the meanes of their admiſſion: <hi>Peter</hi> he preached, and many heard him, and ſo many as gladly received the word were baptized, and thus they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church: now being thus encreaſt, in this verſe it is ſhewed how they were afterward imployed; <hi>they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> they went on as they beganne; they beganne religiouſly, and they went on religiouſly: they had the Apoſtles doctrine, and were called by it; <hi>and they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, &amp;.</hi> The reach of the Holy Ghoſt here is this, to commend to us the religious practice of religious profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; and ſo to ſet before us the right forme of a true viſible Church, and he ſets it downe in theſe few words moſt pithily and moſt plainly, that this example of this primitive Church might be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and direction to all ſucceeding Churches to continue to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>The parts of the verſe are two; firſt, the duties they did performe; ſecondly, their cariage in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them. The duties are in number
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16098:265"/>foure; Apoſtles doctrine, fellowſhip, breaking of bread, and prayer: Theſe duties though they be in number but foure, yet they are of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as whereunto we may reduce all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties whatſoever; ſo that when it is ſaid here, that they performed theſe foure, it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they were carefull alſo of all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to their profeſſion; but in theſe they laboured eſpecially, as thoſe that were the chiefe and heads of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Apoſtles doctrine, that is, the word of God, and doctrine of ſalvation that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preached unto them; Indeed it is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe: Yet it is called the Apoſtles, becauſe they were the meſſengers and miniſters of it: no other teachers would they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge but the Apoſtles onely; nor receive no other doctrine but that which they taught them. They had not the whole doctrine of the Apoſtles as yet revealed to them, for moſt of them were but newly converted; how could they continue in it then? The meaning is, that that which they had learned, every one more or leſſe did faithfully continue, and remaine ſtedfaſt in.</p>
            <p>Second duty is fellowſhip: the word in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſignifies communion, for which cauſe ſome underſtand it of the Lords Supper; but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, firſt, the word is never ſo uſed elſewhere in Scripture without addition, (with addition it is, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>the communion of the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>) and ſecondly, becauſe the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſignificantly expreſt in the next words, <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16098:266"/>of bread:</hi> therefore I rather underſtand it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our tranſlation, <hi>fellowſhip;</hi> that is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall communion and participation in all duties and offices of Chriſtian love and concord one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another; whereof three particulars are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the verſes following, verſe 44, 45, and 46, <hi>they had all things</hi> (that is, all worldly goods) <hi>common:</hi> thoſe that had any, communicating free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the uſe of thoſe that had none; here was Chriſtian fellowſhip indeed, they laid all their goods and poſſeſſions together, and made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtocke for the maintenance of the whole Church; and ſecondly, verſ. 36. <hi>they continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether daily with one accord in the Temple;</hi> here is Chriſtian fellowſhip, to conſent and joyne all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as one man in Gods worſhip: thirdly, <hi>and breaking bread at home;</hi> here is Chriſtian fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not onely in Gods Temple, but even at their own private houſes; not only at the Lords Table, but at their owne ordinary meales, they met lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly together, and dranke together, and were Chriſtianly merry together; for ſo are the words, <hi>with gladneſſe of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, breaking of bread: the phraſe doth ſometime, and indeed moſt properly, ſignifie the receiving of their naturall and daily food; as in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.35. compared with verſe 30; and there is good reaſon for that phraſe, becauſe bread is the ſtaffe of our life, and the chiefe of all our food; therefore all our food is uſually and fitly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the name of bread, and breaking of bread; a matter ſpecially in uſe among the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16098:266"/>Iewes, for they made their bread into Cakes of thinne Loaves, and ſo they might, and ordinarily did breake them with their hands, they were not ſo thick or tough that they needed any knives to cut them; and from this their ordinary practice is the phraſe borrowed, and applyed to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of their ſpirituall food in the Lords Supper, and that very fitly and ſignificantly, there being a breaking of bread after a ſpeciall manner: The bread there broken is a ſpeciall bread, that is to ſay, ſeparate for a ſpeciall uſe, and a ſpeciall breaking of bread, being a lively and teaching ſigne of the breaking of Chriſts body, and ſo it is called too, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. <hi>And the firſt day of the weeke the Diſciples being come together for to breake bread, Paul preached unto them;</hi> where it is meant of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: and that it is ſo meant here, it appeares to be cleare, becauſe of the other religious duties that it is ſorted withall, for they would not put in the receiving of their naturall food amongſt theſe things: and againe, that is put in afterward in 46. <hi>verſ.</hi> and hee calls it their breaking of bread at home in oppoſition to this. Neither yet is it to be underſtood, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one part of the Sacrament is here onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that is, breaking of bread; that therefore they were denyed the other, that is, drinking the wine, as the Papiſts would beare us in hand, but a part is put for the whole; the naming of one part in right reaſon, certainly preſuppoſing they had the other; as we ſee in 46 <hi>verſ.</hi> in the receiving of their naturall food, onely bread, no drinke is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:16098:267"/>and ſo it will follow by the Papſits rule, that they had no drinke at home neither; a groſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but if it bee ingenuouſly and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly conſidered, wee cannot but conceive the drinke too, and that the naming of the one doth certainly preſuppoſe the other too: ſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things ſo uſually and naturally joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo it is likewiſe in the ſacrament, the naming of the bread doth certainly preſuppoſe the wine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, prayers which is ſpecially to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of publike prayers; no doubt but everie one had their private devotions and prayers, for many of their owne private and particular neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and no doubt but they were frequent in them too; but yet the other three being publique and common duties, this is to be preſumed to be ſo too, and indeed it is the ſpeciall reach of the Euangeliſt here, to ſhew their care in publike and common exerciſes; here are the duties which they did performe, which is the firſt part of the verſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part is their cariage in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe duties, they continued in them: our tranſlation comes farre ſhort of the force of the Originall, for that ſignifies not onely that they continued in them, (though that bee a great commendation) but that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in them with much diligence, and with ſtrong patience; they did not (as many of us doe) intermit them at their owne pleaſures, and uſe them as their owne caſe of worldly buſineſſe would give them leave; but they continued with
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16098:267"/>much dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, al other things laid by to give way to theſe exerciſes, in their ſeaſon. Nor yet were they diſmayed with the ſcoffes and reproaches of the world, nor with the oppoſition of Sathan, (as no doubt they had verie many) but ſtrongly and patiently went through them all, and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their godly courſes: This is the fulneſſe of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation; the duties themſelves are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent duties, and their carriage in them is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Good exerciſes ſleightly performed are not praiſe-worthy, no not amongſt men; but ſuch excellent duties as theſe, <hi>The Apoſtles doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> ſo excellently carried as they are here, continuing in them, theſe have praiſe, and that of God. Lay al theſe together, and ſee what a comfortable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle here is in theſe Chriſtians to a religious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder: They had the Apoſtles doctrine, there is their faith and knowledge; They had fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip amongſt them, there is their love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; They had breaking of bread, there is their remembrance of the death of Chriſt; They had prayers, there is their zeale and devotion; and they continued in all theſe, here is their conſtancy and perſeverance. Firſt, they had the Apoſtles Doctrine, that is the ground and ſubſtance of their religion. Secondly, Fellowſhip, that is the fruit and life of their religion. Thirdly, Breaking of bread, that is the ſeale and bond of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Fourthly, Prayers, that is the ſinews and ſtrength of their religion. And laſtly, They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in all theſe, that is the grace and beauty of their religion. It being the reach of the Holy
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16098:268"/>Ghoſt to ſet before us (as I ſhewed before) the right forme of a true viſible Church in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: We may ſee here what a glorious forme of a true viſible Church is here preſented unto us. So much of the reach of the Holy Ghoſt, and of the parts and meaning of theſe words.</p>
            <p>Now we will proceed to the obſervations, and the firſt is from the reach of the place: And firſt, in that the Holy Ghoſt doth here ſet forth theſe religious Profeſſors unto us by their practice of religious duties; hence the obſervation is this, namely, that it is or muſt bee the practice of all true Profeſſors of religion to be daily converſant in the exerciſes of religion, both in the duties of the firſt and ſecond Table, piety towards God, &amp; love towards men; both theſe are here ſpecified; The Apoſtles Doctrine, breaking of bread, and prayer, and their continuance therein are duties of the firſt Table; Fellowſhip or Chriſtian love, and continuance therein, are duties of the ſecond Table. The whole tenure of the Booke of GOD, both in the old and new Teſtament tends direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the proofe of this Doctrine. I will cull out ſome few, and firſt I will give you a place or two for the generall; of all duties together, both of the firſt and ſecond Table; and then I will come to the particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the generall: <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Goe therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, &amp;c.</hi> In the 19. verſe there is their
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16098:268"/>commiſſion to plant Churches throughout the world; and how muſt they plant them? by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and baptizing; and how are theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to cary themſelves after they are thus plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? verſe 20. they muſt obſerve and doe all thoſe things that the Lord Ieſus commanded his Apoſtles: now Chriſt Ieſus he is a perfect Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, an exact Teacher; inſtructing his Apoſtles no doubt in all duties both of the firſt and ſecond Table; and therefore all that profeſſe to be of the Church, muſt bee daily converſant in the practice of all good duties, both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men: <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men hath appeared; and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that wee ſhould deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and that wee ſhould live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world:</hi> The ſaving grace of God is here compared to a Schoole-maſter or Teacher, and conſequently profeſſors thereof to Schollers: now what is the leſſon that this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter teacheth to all theſe Schollers? <hi>To deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly:</hi> that is, to abſtaine from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſinne, and to doe every good duty to God, and men, and our ſelves, all the duties both of the firſt and ſecond Table. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>Furthermore brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things pertaine to love, whatſoever things are of good report, if there bee any vertue or any praiſe, thinke on theſe things; which yee have both learned, and received, and heard, and ſeene
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:16098:269"/>in me, theſe things do, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> Theſe Philippians were much furthered in the profeſſion of the Goſpell by <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſtery; many heavenly leſſons had they received from him by word, writing, and example; and this is the laſt of all his exhortations in this Epiſtle, as containing the ſumme of all the reſt; and here he reckons up all ſorts of good duties; <hi>Whatſoever things are true, &amp;c.</hi> and he preſſeth his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a ſerious obteſtation, <hi>If there be any vertue, or if there be any praiſe, thinke on theſe things:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, You profeſſe the things that are true, thinke on the things that are true, and doe them, <hi>and the God of peace ſhall be with you:</hi> you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the things that be honeſt; think on the things that be honeſt, and doe them, <hi>and the God of peace ſhall be with you:</hi> you profeſſe the things that are juſt; thinke on the things that are juſt, and doe them, <hi>and the God of peace ſhall be with you:</hi> you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the things that are pure; thinke on theſe things, and doe them, <hi>and the God of peace ſhall bee with you:</hi> you profeſſe love; thinke on love, and practiſe love, <hi>and the God of peace ſhall be with you:</hi> you profeſs things of good report; think on them, and doe them, <hi>and the God of peace ſhall be with you:</hi> if ever you looke for peace with God, ſee that you think on, &amp; do the good things that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: ye profeſſe religiouſly; thinke and doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, and certainly the God of peace will be with you. Here is a moſt ſerious exhortation as any is in the Booke of God: that is for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. Now for the ſeverall duties of the firſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16098:269"/>and ſecond table: and firſt of the firſt table; in the 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16. to 21. <hi>Rejoyce evermore; pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; In all things give thankes; quench not the ſpirit; deſpiſe not prophecying.</hi> Ioy in God; prayer; thankes; cheriſhing the ſpirit and good motions; embracing the Word that Gods Prophets and Miniſters bring unto us: theſe and ſuch like, are duties of the firſt Table which wee muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in.</p>
            <p>And ſo for the ſecond table, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8. this is a true ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou ſhouldſt affirme, that they which have beleeved in God, might bee carefull to ſhew forth good workes: as many as beleeve, as many as profeſſe the faith of Chriſt Ieſus, muſt be carefull to ſhew forth all good duties that are profitable to men; which ſpecially are thoſe of the ſecond Table: if we take a view of all true profeſſors that are approved in Scripture; we ſhall find them all wel experienced in the practice of the duties of both tables: it is true they had their failings, but yet this was the ordinary bent of all their courſes.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why we muſt doe thus? there are many reaſons.</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon is this: becauſe the practice of theſe duties is the grace of our profeſſion: the grace of all morall vertues conſiſts in the actions of vertue; and the grace of every trade conſiſts not ſo much in the knowledge of the trade, as in the well managing of that trade: our Chriſtian profeſſion is a vertue and a trade: a ſpirituall vertue and a heavenly trade, therefore the grace
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16098:270"/>of it ſtands in our well managing of it, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all religious duties; godly cariage in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the meaneſt that profeſſe religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in all, doth adorne and beautiſie and grace the doctrine of God our Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. not that wee can adde any grace to religion in it ſelfe; no, in it ſelfe, and of it ſelfe it is moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſo that it need not, nor cannot, receive any grace from our doing; but that thereby we grace it before men, our friends that like us the better for it; and our enemies that are put to ſhame and ſilence by it; yea and oft-times are forced to ſpeake well of our Religion for our practice; and we alſo procure a more reverent eſtimation of our profeſſion generally in the world: When we take this holy profeſſion upon us, it graceth us; and when we praſtice hereby anſwerable to this holy profeſſion, we grace it; therefore this wee muſt doe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is the life of our faith: it can live no longer then it is exerciſed in good duties; as <hi>Rachel, Gen.</hi> 39.1. ſaid to <hi>Iacob, Give me children or elſe I dye:</hi> ſo likewiſe ſaith faith to the ſoule of a Chriſtian, give me children, let mee bring forth fruits of piety towards God, and charity towards man; elſe I dye and have no life in me. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith as much, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.26. <hi>Faith without works it dead:</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.1. God tells the Church of <hi>Sardis, That ſhe had a name to live, but was dead;</hi> becauſe her practice was not anſwerable to her profeſſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. her faith and religion was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to die; how ſo? <hi>I have not found thy workes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16098:270"/>before God;</hi> there was a great failing in the practice of Religion; when good exerciſes dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, ſaith dies amongſt us; when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay within us, faith decayes, it lyes a bleeding: but when they are well practiſed, that ſaith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love, that is, both to God and man, then our faith lives and thrives within us: therefore we muſt practiſe good duties both to God and men, elſe faith cannot live within us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is the end of our calling: 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>For God hath not called us unto uncleanneſſe, but unto holineſſe;</hi> that is, to the practiſe of holy and religious duties: when a man is called of purpoſe to doe a worke, ſhall hee come, and not doe that which he is called to, and come for, this were a ſhamefull and a ſenſleſſe thing: either let him not come when he is called, or when he is come, let him doe that which hee is called unto. The maine matter that Chriſtians are called unto is holineſſe, therefore if wee doe not practiſe holy and religious duties, wee goe quite beſide the marke, and to the profeſſion we aime at.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is one maine condition that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on our part, when wee are firſt admitted to the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie; it is ſo required by God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his, and let every one that calleth on the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity:</hi> And it is ſo undertaken by us in baptiſme, that we will renounce the world, the fleſh, and the Devill, and become dutifull Children unto God in the practiſe of all holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he requires: This then being our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:16098:271"/>in Chriſtianity, therefore we muſt practiſe it or elſe we ſhall never come to heaven.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God ſcornes and hates all Profeſſors of his name, that will not obey his will, hee utterly renounceth them and their profeſſion to be none of his; ſo he doth here in this world, and ſo he will doe hereafter: ſo hee doth here, as wee may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. <hi>But unto the wicked ſaith God, what haſt thou to doe, to declare mine ordinances, that thou ſhouldeſt take my covenant in thy mouth?</hi> Lay this to heart, and ſee if God ſay not thus to every one of us here preſent. <hi>What haſt thou to doe to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my houſe, and to profeſſe my name, ſeeing thou wilt not obey my will, but hateſt to be reformed?</hi> And ſo he will ſcorne and deny them hereafter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Then will I profeſſe to them, I never knew you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, you that worke iniquity;</hi> though they profeſſe never ſo much, yet if their practice bee not anſwerable, God will ſcorne and hate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them here, and ſo he will doe hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Vſes are theſe: Firſt, this ſerves for matter of reproofe, of divers ſorts, indeed of all ſorts: For who is there here among us, yea what profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor living upon the earth, that is not rightly taxed and reproved for the breach of this doctrine? what profeſſing man or woman in the world, can ſay, My heart is cleane in this kinde? Every one is faulty, ſome more, ſome leſſe: let our owne courſes be our owne accuſers: The whole Land profeſſeth Gods Religion, as being a nationall Church; but how few be there in the whole land, that are daily converſant in the exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:16098:271"/>either they doe not performe them at all, or elſe if they doe them, yet they doe not make conſcience of them; but they doe them overly, and for faſhion: at leaſt, they doe not make it their daily and continuall practice; but onely now and then when they liſt themſelves: Who is zealous for the Lord of Hoſts? Who ſtands up to maintaine the cauſe of the common good? but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is for his owne good: nay, who is it that is ſincerely earneſt for the ſaving of his own ſoule? We know that the word of God is ſcarce in many places, in all places it is little ſet by; Chriſtian fellowſhip is baniſht from amongſt us; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments much abuſed; publike prayers condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of ſome, contemned of others; and by ſome turned into meere babling: The field of this land hath beene plentifully ſowne with the ſeed of Gods word, but where are the fruits? Thiſtles, and thornes, and weeds, great ſtore; ſinnes and corruptions, and oathes, without number: igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, prophaneneſſe, oathes, blaſphemies, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, deceit, and all manner of evill reignes and rules amongſt us; but good fruits are verie few, or none at all: every one of you knows this to be too true; &amp; if you were asked in your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, you would acknowledge and ſay as much your ſelves. Then marvell not, beloved, that the Lord is incenſt with anger againſt this Land; marvell not that ſo many judgments are inflicted on us; marvell not that ſuch great floods of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe now make havocke of the commodities of the earth, the corne and the graſſe; marvell not
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:16098:272"/>at this; but rather marvel that the Lord ſhews not forth his wrath upon us to the utmoſt, and that he that hath moſt juſtly drowned our graſſe and corn with floods of waters, hath not alſo poured forth the floods of his everlaſting wrath, and drowned us ſoules and bodies in hell. There is juſt cauſe for all this; for the Lord hath made choice of this Land as his owne Vineyard, as it is in <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. and hath planted it with the beſt plants, and hath dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, &amp;c. and looked for grapes, that is, godly and religious duties; but we have brought forth wilde grapes, ſinnes and rebellions, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all ſorts; but no pleaſing fruits unto God. To come nearer; this City profeſſeth as well as any City in the world, I may ſafely ſpeake it; none profeſſeth a more holy and ſound Religion, nor would ſeeme to be more forward in it; but where is the life and practice of Religion? Is it in our Churches? there indeed it ſhould bee; but is it there? wee tender indeed oft-times our bodies there, when our mindes are abroad on the world, or here ſet upon ſome preſent vanity. Is it then in our houſes? the hard dealing of maſters to their ſervants; the nice education of children in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe and idleneſſe, without Gods feare, and without any ordinary calling, too too common through this whole City, and the children of our greateſt Citizens rue it daily; and our neglect of private catechizing and prayer, witneſſeth againſt us, that it is not in our houſes: If it bee not in Gods houſe, nor in our owne houſes, is it then in our ſhops and ware-houſes; indeed there it is
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:16098:272"/>moſt needfull, but there it is leaſt uſed. Lying, and ſwearing, and deceiving, and over-reaching is there more gainfull to us, and therefore are the more practiſed. Is it then in the ſtreets? no, they are very ſtages of naughtineſs and vanity. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand baites are there to allure our eyes and eares to ſome evill or other, not one to goodneſſe: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious practices dare not ſhew their heads in our ſtreets. If we looke into the City it is bad, if into the Suburbs it is worſe; if we look into our ſelves, or wives, or our children, or our dyet, ſpecially into our apparell; all theſe teſtifie againſt us, that we practiſe nothing leſſe than the Religion wee profeſſe.</p>
            <p>I ſaid before, no City in the world goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in profeſſion than this City; I ſay now, No profeſſing Citie in the world is of leſſe or worſe practice than this is: profeſſing Cities, ſaid I? nay, thoſe that never profeſt Religion, <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> we may compare with them; the pride, and fulneſſe of bread, and idleneſſe, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable filthineſſe, and uncleanneſſe of this City, cryes out in every corner for fire and brimſtone to be poured downe from heaven upon us.</p>
            <p>To come nearer to our ſelves; looke into our owne Pariſh and Congregation; I cannot but grieve, and am aſhamed, that by my weake la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the labours of ſo many my good Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and aſſiſtants, ſo long continued in this place, ſo few are brought to be duly converſant in religious duties: One is given to the world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to his pleaſure, another to drinking, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pettiſhneſſe, another envies at his brothers
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16098:273"/>proſperity, another is ſelfe-willed, another is a ſwearer, another a prophaner of the Sabbath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thinkes much of an houre or two ſpent in Gods ſervice on the Lords day: all of us profeſſe Religion, yet this is our irreligious practice: ſome of you happely make ſome conſcience of the duties of the firſt Table, hearing, praying, and ſome other parts of Gods worſhip; but are not ſo conſcionable of the ſecond Table; either you neglect your ordinary calling, or are unjuſt in your dealing; an exception too common and too juſt againſt many great profeſſors. On the other ſide, ſome are carefull of the duties of the ſecond Table, they are juſt in their dealing, and will wrong no man wittingly; and ſo thinke that is Religion enough to be ſaved by. Oh my brethren, you are deceived on both ſides; it is true that both theſe kinde of duties be good, but ſo as they be both practiſed together, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is Gods commandement, that we beleeve in his Sonne, and love one another:</hi> where all the duties of the firſt Table are commanded under the name of faith, and the ſecond under the name of love; God commands both, and we muſt practiſe both: Thou that art carefull in the duties of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if thou be not withall carefull in good duties towards thy ſelfe and men, thy faith ſhall never ſave thee: On the other ſide, thou that art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of good duties towards thy ſelfe and men, if thou be not withall carefull of the duties that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, thy love ſhall never ſave thee.</p>
            <p>Second Vſe: It ſerves for tryall, it will bring
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:16098:273"/>every one of us to the true touchſtone, whereby we may prove our profeſſion to bee ſound and good, we all profeſſe Gods holy religion, if our hearts and lives be able to ſpeake for us, that wee be duely converſant in the practice of holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, we may boldly conclude, that we are true and ſound profeſſors: but if our practice be naught, this our profeſſion is nothing worth to us; our Saviour himſelfe ſets the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in thoſe very termes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24.28. If we heare Gods Word and doe it, we build upon a rocke, and whatſoever comes we ſhall ſurely be ſaved; but if we heare, and doe not, we build but upon the ſand, we are fooliſh builders, wee and our building ſhall fall, and our fall ſhall be great, even downe to hell. And the like touchſtone doth the Apoſtle bring us to, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.21. to 24. Many learne Chriſt, but none learne Chriſt <hi>as the truth is in Ieſus,</hi> that is to ſay, none are indued with any ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, but thoſe that have put off the old man, and put on the new, that is to ſay, thoſe that practice Chriſt Ieſus, as wel as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him.</p>
            <p>Laſt uſe is for exhortation; let us therefore be as we ſeem to be, let us doe as we ſay, let us practiſe as we profeſſe; <hi>if ye know theſe things</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>oh bleſſed are you if you doe them: If you live in the ſpirit</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>then let us walke in the ſpirit.</hi> The good things we know and profeſſe let us meditate upon them, and doe them, and the God of peace ſhall be with us, with us here, and with us hereafter.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the occaſion of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, we are now to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from the Catechiſme, to the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>They continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayer.</hi> The reaſon why we made choiſe of this Scripture for the matter of this ſacrament, was becauſe the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is here called by the name of the breaking of bread: that being the firſt thing wee entred upon, that is, the names and titles whereby this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called: we ſhewed you that this, and the verſe going before, containes the ſucceſſe of the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16098:275"/>ſermon that <hi>Peter</hi> made immediately upon the comming downe of the viſible gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. In the former verſe he ſhewes how they were increaſed: In this verſe, how they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; <hi>They continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> We ſhewed the parts of this verſe to be two: firſt the duties they were converſant in, <hi>the Apoſtles doctrine, fellowſhip, breaking of bread, and prayer:</hi> Secondly, the manner of performance of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they continued in all theſe: or they did ſtrongly and ſtoutly againſt all oppoſitions, and yet with all patience, goe on in the performance of theſe duties: One part of the reach of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in this place (I ſhewed you) was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto us the religious practice of religious profeſſors. Another part of his reach herein was to ſet forth unto us a true forme and patterne of a true viſible Church. From the firſt of the reach of the holy Ghoſt in this place, we have obſerved this doctrine: That all that profeſſe Religion, their life and practice muſt be anſwerable to their profeſſion; they muſt be daily converſant in the practice of religious duties both of the firſt and ſecond Table. Now we are to come to the other part of the reach; that is, that the holy Ghoſt ſets before us the patterne and example of a true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church in theſe Chriſtians; and that this is one part of his reach appeares plainly by this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth ſo preciſely and exactly ſet downe and deſcribe the cariage and behaviour of theſe Chriſtians after their calling and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which he would not have done, but that hee
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:16098:275"/>had a purpoſe to ſet before us a true patterne of a viſible Church; That theſe were a Church, it can be no queſtion, for they are expreſly ſo called, <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. <hi>the Lord added to the Church, &amp;c.</hi> And that they were a true Church, it is no queſtion; for if there were ever any, this was one; the Apoſtles themſelves being their teachers, and the people being ſo effectually called immediately after the ſending downe of the viſible gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. And that they were a viſible Church, it is no queſtion, becauſe they made open profeſſion of that Chriſtian faith which they had received: and therefore this reach and drift of the place rightly conſidered, it is as if he ſhould ſay, theſe Chriſtians thus receiving the Word, and being thus baptized, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. were now a true viſible Church. And this is the ſtate and condition that they were growne into and ſetled upon; <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayer;</hi> and ſo have a right forme of a true viſible Church. For the better underſtanding of this point, we will firſt conſider of the holy Ghoſt in taking this courſe; and then ſecondly, we will come to the inſtructions: Firſt, let us conſider the wiſedome of the holy Ghoſt, in taking this courſe, and that we may diſcerne in theſe two particulars; firſt in that hee thought it needfull, that there ſhould be ſome exact pattern of a true viſible Church extant in ſcripture, that all ſucceeding Churches were to be examined by and conformed unto; ſecondly, in that hee made choyce this Church, as a moſt fit patterne for
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16098:276"/>that purpoſe. Firſt we are to conſider of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Holy Ghoſt, in that hee thought it needfull, that there ſhould be ſome exact pattern of a true viſible Church extant in Scripture, for all ſucceeding Churches to bee examined by and conformed unto: The Lord ſaw that it would be a matter of great conſequence; he knew on the one ſide, that many congregations would pretend themſelves to bee a true viſible Church, when indeed they are not ſo; and on the other ſide, he ſaw that thoſe which are true Churches indeed, would be called into queſtion about their ſtate, by their enemies ſlandering them, and traducing them as falſe Churches: And therefore he would have ſome abſolute patterne of a true viſible Church to be found in Scripture, whereby true beleevers might juſtifie themſelves, and their owne ſtanding; and convince all falſe Churches whatſoever: As a ſtraight rule ſhewes both the crookedneſſe of that which is crooked, and the ſtraightneſſe of that which is ſtraight; So a true patterne of a true viſible Church, ſerves as well to diſcover the falſhood of a falſe Church; as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the truth of a true. The Lord knew that many Chriſtians would be much offended at the manifold differences that from time to time wold ariſe amongſt profeſſours, touching the ſtate of a Church; and ſo ſtand in a mamering not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Church to joyne themſelves unto; and therfore for their ſakes he thought it fit and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that ſuch a patterne ſhould be ſet before us, as that we may be reſolved which Churches wee
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16098:276"/>may ſafely and boldly enter into, and ſtand in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion withall: And howſoever this alſo might bee and is ſufficiently taught in the Scripture by certaine precepts, rules, and directions, yet one example and patterne doth more ſenſibly worke upon us, and ſwayes us more in our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, judgement, affections, and practice, than twenty precepts: examples are ſtrong perſwaders, and pregnant and lively teachers; and therefore here is the wiſedome of God that hee doth thus furniſh us with a true patterne of a true viſible Church in Scripture: ſecondly, herein the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God doth alſo appeare, in that he makes choice of this preſent Church, as a moſt ſenſible and fit patterne for that purpoſe: for this was the firſt Church that ever was after Chriſts aſcenſion, and the viſible comming downe of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; and wee may call it the very prime of the Primitive Churches: and where ſhall wee have a fitter patterne of a true viſible Church, than that which is fetcht from the firſt viſible Church after our Saviours aſcenſion. Vſually Gods ordinances are beſt at the firſt inſtitution, when they are freſh out of Gods hands, ſpick and ſpan new as it were: In time when they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens handling they are degenerate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; but at the firſt when they come out of Gods handling, then they are moſt pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. Mariage is the ordinance of God; and the firſt mariage that ever was, was the beſt mariage that ever was; and that is the patterne that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are to be examined and faſhioned by; as our
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:16098:277"/>Saviour ſheweth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.4.5. the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is Gods ordinance; and the firſt that ever was was the beſt that ever was; and that is the pattern which all other Suppers of the Lord are to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by; as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. So this being the firſt Church after Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was in beſt caſe of all other Churches; and therefore that was a fit patterne for other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be tryed and cenſured by. But ſome will except, and ſay, What, is this the beſt Church that ever was? What ſay you of the particular Churches that were ſoone after? as of the Church of Rome, and Corinth, and Epheſus, &amp;c. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they were goodly Churches, and had ſome more outward complement than this had; but they had no more for ſubſtance than this had; yea, they had many failings and corruptions that this as yet was free from. Others will except and ſay, But what ſay you of the Church when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelfe lived and was perſonally preſent, and preached on earth: I anſwer, firſt, That even in reſpect of Chriſts owne perſonall preſence, yet this is nothing inferiour to that; for now after the ſending downe of the Holy Ghoſt hee is preſent with them by his Spirit; and this preſence of his by his Spirit, is as effectuall for all ſaving purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as his bodily preſence was; as our Saviour ſhewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16, 17, 18. Secondly, I ſay, that ſetting only Chriſts perſonall preſence aſide, that was not comparable to this; for then the Church was not ſo throughly furniſhed with gifts as now it was; yea then the Apoſtles themſelves had not
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:16098:277"/>received that fulneſſe of power from on high as now they had. Take it thus, Chriſt Ieſus by his life, and preaching, and miracles, did as it were plant the Church; Chriſt Ieſus by his death and reſurrection did as it were water the Church; Chriſt Ieſus by his aſcenſion and ſending downe of the Holy Ghoſt, ripened his Church, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it with all ſufficient gifts, and brought it to perfection. Beſides, that Church was onely a provinciall Church, conſiſting of Iewes onely within Iudea, but this is a more generall Church, gathered out of all the Iewes and Proſelites of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nation under heaven, as verſe 5. And indeed this Church is the wombe of all other Churches from thence to the end of the world; all of them iſſuing and proceeding out of this, as ſo many ſtreames out of one fountaine. Rome pretends and challengeth it ſelfe to be the mother Church, but falſely: this, this is the true mother Church of all true viſible Churches: And therefore as the proverb is in another caſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.44. <hi>As is the mother, ſo is her daughter:</hi> ſo in this caſe, ſuch as this Church is, that is the mother; ſuch are all her daughters, ſuch are all true viſibly Churches: So we ſee the wiſedome of the Holy Ghoſt, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe this Church as a patterne to all true viſible Churches whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Now ſecondly wee are to proceed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that hence ariſeth: The doctrine is this: In that the ſtate of this Church is ſet before us as the patterne of true viſible Churches, by this, that <hi>they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:16098:278"/>and breaking of bread, and prayer:</hi> Obſerve, that whereſoever the Word is truly preacht, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments rightly adminiſtred, and the duties of prayer to God, and love to our brethren religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and conſcionably practiſed, there is a true viſible Church of God: I name the manner of performance, together with the duties, becauſe it is ſaid in the Text, they continued in them; which intends that not onely they had ſuch duties, but alſo that they were duly and rightly practiſed: and the doctrine holds, and ſo is here meant reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally, that is to ſay, both wayes; as thus; firſt, whereſoever theſe duties are, there is a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church; and ſecondly, whereſoever is a true viſible Church, there are theſe duties. For proofe of the firſt, that whereſoever theſe are there is a true viſible Church, looke in the 10. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 4. and 27. verſes: in the fourth verſe our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Hee goeth before his ſheepe, and they follow him, for they know his voice:</hi> and in the 27. verſe he ſaith, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt goes before his ſheepe, that is, in the uſe of his owne ſaving ordinances, the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, leading them along thereby in the wayes of ſalvation: for by the voice of Chriſt there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is directly meant the Word preached; and under that the Sacraments are comprehenſibly underſtood, which doe alwayes attend upon the Word, as the Seales upon the Writing. And the ſame voice of Chriſt commanding the exerciſes of prayer, and of love, doth conſequently include them alſo: and when it is ſaid is the 27. verſe,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16098:278"/>
               <hi>They heare his voice, and follow him;</hi> there is ſet downe the practice of theſe duties: So then if one ſhould aske us who are the ſheepe of Chriſt, the anſwer is ready; <hi>they that heare his voice, and follow him:</hi> which is as much to ſay, If any aske which is the true viſible Church? the anſwer is ready; there where is the ordinary uſe of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and prayer, and love to the brethren: <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Goe teach, &amp;c.</hi> The buſineſſe that there the Apoſtles are employed in, is the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of viſible Churches in the world; the meanes whereby they are to plant them, are teaching and baptizing; that is, the Word and the Sacraments: and what muſt they teach them, but to obſerve all that Chriſt commanded? now Chriſt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them ſpecially in prayer, teaching them what, and how to pray; and gave them alſo a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall charge to love one another, as that being his owne ſpeciall commandement, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.12. therefore where theſe things are thus in uſe, as Chriſt commanded them, there is a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereſoever there is a true viſible Church, there the word is truly preacht, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments rightly adminiſtred, and prayer to God, and love to our brethren religiouſly and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably practiſed: I doe not ſay they are there in their height, but in ſome decree; I ſhall not need to prove this, for all the Churches commended to us in Scripture for true Churches, had theſe; as Corinth, Epheſus, and the reſt, as might bee proved either directly or by neceſſary conſequent
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16098:279"/>in them all; no nor any inſtance in the Scripture to the contrary: ſo the doctrine is proved.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are theſe: Firſt, where theſe things are thus uſed, there is the promiſe of Chriſts ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preſence and bleſſing; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. What is it to be gathered together in his name? but to joyne together in the true uſe of his owne ſaving ordinances, in the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Fellowſhip, and ſuch holy duties? Therefore where theſe are, there is Chriſts ſaving preſence and promiſes: now Chriſts ſaving promiſes are peculiar to the Church; he is the head, the Church is the body; the head hath no life to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to any but to its owne body, therefore there is Chriſts true Church. Now the Congregation there ſpoken of is a viſible Congregation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the 17. and 18. verſes; where he ſpeakes of excommunication, and ſuch like; therefore where theſe are, the Word truly preacht, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rightly adminiſtred, prayer to God, and love to the brethren, religiouſly and conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly practiſed, there is a true viſible Church. And this might further bee enlarged in every one of theſe particulars here mentioned; where the word is truly preacht, there is a promiſe of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and bleſſing, and ſo where the Sacraments are rightly adminiſtred; as we may ſee in <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>Goe teach all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c. and loe I am with you alway untill the end of the world.</hi> And ſo for prayer; the Lord hath promiſed his
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16098:279"/>ſaving preſence and bleſſing to thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in religious prayer: <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.19. <hi>If two of you agree in earth upon any thing, whatſoever they ſhall deſire, it ſhall be given them of my Father, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo for love to the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his bleſſing to be there for ever where this love is, <hi>Pſalme 133. the laſt verſe: If God promiſe then his ſaving preſence and bleſſing to every one of theſe in particular; then where all theſe meet together there is a promiſe of his ſaving preſence and bleſſing much more; now Chriſts ſaving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and bleſſing being peculiar to his Church, then where theſe are there is a true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, where theſe duties are truly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is true ſaving faith, at leaſt in outward profeſſion. Now what is a true viſible Church, but a company of thoſe that openly and joyntly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the true ſaving faith; therefore where theſe are, there is a true viſible Church: Let men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe what other Faith or Religion they will, though never ſo plauſible a Religion, and never ſo zealouſly profeſt; yet only the profeſſion of this Faith and Religion makes a true viſible Church; yea, where theſe duties are practiſed, there is true ſaving faith indeed; at leaſt in ſome, though not in all; for they are the meanes to beget and confirme faith; that is, the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and Gods bleſſing alwayes attends on the ordinary uſe of theſe means, to make them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to ſome for ſalvation: And there alſo are the ſpeciall exerciſes of ſaving faith; prayer to God, and love to the Saints; and it cannot
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16098:280"/>be, at leaſt charity forbids us to thinke otherwiſe, but that though many amongſt them, yea moſt of them ſhould bee Hypocrites, yet ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoſe exerciſes in the truth and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their harts, and ſo there is a true Church; if it ſhould ſo fall out that all ſhould be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, yet profeſſing and outwardly practiſing theſe duties, they are a true viſible Church, in regard of the truth of the viſibility of it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alwayes in ſuch congregations there are by the bleſſing of God ſome true beleevers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are true Churches viſible in regard of the truth of a Church among them. And I take it, this is the proper ſenſe of the ſpeech, when we ſpeake of a true viſible Church; that there be ſome true beleevers amongſt them, that make profeſſion of the ſaving faith, for whoſe cauſe they and others that joyne with them, are rightly called a true Church viſible; and not onely a true viſible Church: but that they are as truly a Church as they are truly viſible.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there be the true and right cauſes of a true viſible Church: as firſt, the efficient, God in the miniſtery of his word: <hi>Iames</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his owne will begat he us by the word of truth.</hi> Secondly, there is the materiall cauſe, <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. Thirdly, there is the formall cauſe, their joynt and open profeſſion in the uſe of Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordinances. Laſtly, there is the finall cauſe; the glorifying of God in the embracing of his ſaving Faith and Religion: now where theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are, it is impoſſible but there ſhould bee a true
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16098:280"/>Church; except the Lords owne labour bee in vaine, which cannot be.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there be the true conſtituting parts of a true viſible Church; there is Chriſt the head, as we ſhewed in the firſt reaſon; and there bee the members, Miniſters and people; The Miniſters preaching the Word, adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: inſtructing and perſwading to the duties of prayer and love: And the people conſcionably obeying and practizing thoſe duties; therefore there is the whole body of a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>The Vſes:</p>
            <p>Firſt uſe is matter of reproofe of ſundry Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: firſt of thoſe that oppoſe the firſt branch of the doctrine; Some congregations ſay they have theſe, and yet are no true viſible Churches: but let them ſhew me any ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, where theſe are in any true meaſure; and then let them ſhew mee any juſt cauſe why theſe ſhould not be a true Church: They may be hereticall Churches, and yet true Churches; and they may be ſchiſmaticall Churches, and yet true Churches, except they overthrow the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if they overthrow the foundation, then the Word is not truly taught and received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, nor any other of theſe duties reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly practiſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is for reproofe of thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the other branch of the doctrine: Some Congregations ſay they are true viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet they have not theſe things yes, they have them in ſome meaſure, more or leſſe, or elſe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16098:281"/>they are no true viſible Churches: at leaſt they have the Word truly preached amongſt them, which doth incluſively comprehend the other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The ſtate of a true Church is rightly to be weighed and conſidered, and accordingly theſe things may be affirmed of it. There is a beginning Church that hath the beginnings of theſe things: and there is a flouriſhing Church, and that hath all theſe things in ſome good beauty and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and there is a Church in perſecution, and that hath theſe things, yet with many oppoſitions and interruptions: there is a decaying or a dying Church, and that alſo hath theſe things though decaying and dying, as we may ſee in the Church of <hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it reproves thoſe that pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the true Church, and yet are deſtitute of theſe things. As the Popiſh Church, I mean the faction of the Pope and Cardinalls and Ieſuits, which challenge to themſelves, to bee the onely, or at leaſt the chiefe viſible Church on earth; and yet are farre to ſeeke in the practice of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: For firſt; the Apoſtles doctrine that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, is mingled with mens traditions; and maſtered by the Popes interpretation; and ſubdued unto the cenſure of their Church; and ſo upon the point, it is their owne doctrine, not the Apoſtles. Then for the Sacraments of God, they have them indeed, yet ſorted with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, and corrupted with many propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and ſuperſtitions; and foully ſtained with mens inventions. And concerning brotherly love
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16098:281"/>and fellowſhip, herein they would ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell all other; oh ſay they, wee are full of Almes, and good workes. And no marvell: For which of us would not give all he hath to the poore, if hee were thorowly perſwaded that hee ſhould merit heaven by it. But what is their practice of love? to get all to themſelves: for looke in all places where Popery hath raigned, &amp; tell me if they have not encrocht, upon the greateſt, or upon the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and fatteſt part of the Land; if they doe part with any thing, it is to uphold the Popes crowne, or the Ieſuits faction. And if they did build hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls, or give almes, they did it with opinion of merit, which marres all to themſelves; or to bee ſeene of men, and then they have their reward: happily the poore fare the better for it, but they themſelves performe no true ſervice to God in it; nor yet can receive no true comfort by it. So for prayer, many of them ſpend a great part of their time in prayer, but they pray to Saints, as well as to God; yea they doe not pray to God, but by the interceſſion of Saints: and all is done uſually in an unknowne tongue, without underſtanding; they know not what they aske; and what comfort can they have in ſuch prayers? So then howſoever they pretend, and ſay wee have the Church, wee have the Church; yet it is but as the Iewes ſaid, The Temple of the Lord, the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Lord; when indeed they were deſtitute of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Lord. I doubt not but that there live under that government, many true beleevers, that worſhip God in ſome meaſure in ſpirit and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:16098:282"/>truth. But how that popiſh faction may be called a true viſible Church, that I referre to the cenſure of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>The ſecond uſe is for application, to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent particular Church of <hi>England</hi> that we live in. Firſt, here is matter of confirmation, that wee have a true viſible Church, and that our ſtanding in it, is warrantable, ſafe, and good; and if wee walke conſcionably and uprightly therein, we are in the ready way to heaven; for to live in a true viſible Church is not a thing ſo comfortable for it ſelfe, but for the greatneſſe of the conſequent, becauſe if we are in a viſible Church, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we are in the ordinary way to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, elſe not. Therefore it ſtands us much upon, to to looke well to our ſelves herein: if therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us be ſcrupulous in our ſelves, or any other of our adverſaries deny us to bee a true Church, or call us in queſtion about it, here is a ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to confirme and ſecure us in it; wee have through Gods mercy the Apoſtles doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us truly preacht; the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred; the duties of prayer to God, and love to the brethren by many of us religiouſly and conſcionably practiſed; therefore wee are a true viſible Church. And this wee dare to hold out as a flag of defiance againſt all our oppoſites and ſlanderers, the Papiſts on the one ſide, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts on the other: let them ſay and doe their worſt to diſprove us in it; we doe not juſtifie any abaſes or corruptions amongſt us, God forbid we ſhould; no, wee abhorre them; and mourne and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:16098:282"/>groane under the burthen of them, and pray to God againſt them; and uſe all the lawfull meanes ſo farre as in us lies, for the reformation of them. But for the true being of our Church, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by our adverſaries, we muſt juſtifie Gods ordinances amongſt us. I ſay therefore againe, and I ſpeake it with confidence, and comfort, and glory to God, we have the Word truly preached, the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred; the duties of prayer to God, and love to the brethren in ſome good meaſure amongſt us religiouſly and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably practiſed, therefore wee are a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts lay hard at us, you the Church, ſay they! no, you are a company of heretiques, and no true Church. We anſwer, wee embrace the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine, the written word, wholly and onely; that, and nothing but that for matter of faith; and if this be hereſie, we are content to bee called heretiques: and we ſay further with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24.14. <hi>After the way that they call hereſie, ſo worſhip we the God of our fathers:</hi> wee beleeve the Word of God, and all that is written in it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live by that rule; let theſe men call it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or what they will, we know we worſhip God in it aright, therefore are no heretiques as they charge us to be.</p>
            <p>The Separatiſts they charge us alſo that wee are no true Church; you a true Church, ſay they! no, you are a limme of Antichriſt. An uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeech and a heavy ſlaunder, and till it be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially proved, the burthen of the ſlander lies
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:16098:283"/>on themſelves, and the Lord forgive them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them for it: heare is our ſhield againe, to ward off this fiery dart too: if the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and fellowſhip, &amp;c. be Antichriſtian, then let us be taken for limmes of Antichriſt; but if theſe be true Chriſtian duties; then we that in the truth of our hearts labour the practice of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are a true Chriſtian Church. But ſay they you faile in many things, you have not the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, and therefore are no true Church. I anſwer, ſome diſcipline wee have, though not that which they pretend: But what then, if wee have not that diſcipline which they pretend, are wee therefore no true Church: by the ſame reaſon this Church here mentioned, may bee proved to bee no true Church neither: for the diſcipline which theſe men pretend, was not in uſe, nor in being, nor in name, when this Church was in this glorious beauty; for as yet there were no deacons at all, as is plaine in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 6: and yet they are the firſt and moſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe Church-officers, next unto the Apoſtles that the Scripture ſpeakes of: I but ſay they, the diſcipline which was preſently after eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was to bee uſed in all other ſucceeding Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for ever. I anſwer, it is true, that the ſame diſcipline that was eſtabliſht by the Apoſtles for all ſucceeding Churches, is to bee retained and uſed in them all: but that one and the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in every particular is ſo eſtabliſhed in the Word for all Churches, that reſts to bee proved. I ſay in particular; for in the generall, we confeſſe
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:16098:283"/>diſcipline, and wee have diſcipline, though not that particular which they urge; yea they muſt not onely prove that there is ſuch a diſcipline in particular, but alſo that it is eſſentially or inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably neceſſary to the true being of a true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, elſe their argument againſt us is of no force at all, (You have not ſuch a diſcipline, therefore no true Church.) Now, for our parts we doe acknowledge diſcipline neceſſary for the beauty and wel being of the Church; but not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially or inſeparably neceſſary to the truth and being of it; for if it were ſo, then Chriſt ſhould be the head of divers Churches differing in eſſence and nature: and that this Church that had not this diſcipline did differ in eſſence and being from the ſucceeding Churches that had it; which is falſe and impious to affirme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhould teach us thankfulneſſe to God, that we of this Nation which once ſate in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, that were firſt drowned in Paganiſme, and after in Popery, that now we ſhould have this great light ſhining amongſt us; that we ſhould have the Word and the Sacraments, and the duties of prayer to God, and love to the brethren in ſome meaſure conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and religiouſly practiſed amongſt us; this we are to be thankfull to God for; wee doe not juſtifie any corruption that is amongſt us, they are our owne; but theſe good things are Gods, and therefore hee is to have praiſe and thankes for them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it ſhould teach us to live and reſt in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:16098:284"/>the communion of this Church; harken not to whiſperers and ſeducers that would entice you from us, and ſay, Come to this Church, goe to that Church, &amp;c. they are like unto thoſe that our Saviour forewarns us of in theſe laſt times, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.23. that ſay, <hi>Loe here is Chriſt, and loe there is Chriſt,</hi> (for he that tells us of a new Church, may as well tell us of a new Chriſt) <hi>but beleeve it not,</hi> ſaith our Saviour: ſo ſay I unto you, Give no eare to them, goe not after them, ſtand faſt in that Chriſtian reſolution of Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.68. Chriſt asketh them in the 67. verſe, <hi>What, will you alſo forſake me?</hi> they anſwer him very graciouſly and reſolutely, <hi>Maſter, whither or to whom ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of eternall life:</hi> our Church hath through Gods mercy the Apoſtles doctrine, the words of eternall life; and therefore whither or to whom ſhould you go from us?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it ſhould teach us to make uſe of theſe duties, by frequenting the preaching of the Word, and the Sacraments, and Prayers, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together in love-duties; let us labour to walke in the light of the word, and to profit by it, while we enjoy it, leſt it be taken from us and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto thoſe that will bring forth better fruits than we have done: And ſeeing wee tender our ſelves monthly to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, let us take heed how we come to it; let us not come hand over head to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it; but let us bring our wedding garment, Faith and Repentance with us; that ſo wee may be welcome gueſts to the Lords Table.</p>
            <pb n="317" facs="tcp:16098:284"/>
            <p>Laſtly, let us pray to God for the continuance of theſe meanes amongſt us; pray for the peace of Ieruſalem; wiſh her proſperity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us doe all we can to procure her wealth; and if there be any abuſes or corruptions amongſt us, let us pray to God to reforme them; and let us not goe beyond the compaſſe of our callings; for wee have no meanes to uſe for redreſſe herein, but prayer to God, that he would bee pleaſed to remove all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, and to continue theſe meanes unto us, that as he hath made us a true viſible Church; ſo hee would continue unto us his Word, and other his ſaving ordinances, that we may be a true viſible Church every day more purer than other unto the worlds end.</p>
